**Isabel:** Hi, it's Isabel and we've just come back from the Jack Wills Unsigned Freshers' Tour and now we're here at the brand new Islington store. So today in the basement here at this store we've got two girls you may recognise from the Jack Wills Unsigned website who we interviewed a few months ago. We've got Charlotte Campbell and Elena Torma playing for us today.

**Charlotte:** I'm going to do a cover of by Akon's just because I think it's jokes. So, hey.

**Isabel:** So I'm now sitting here with Charlotte Campbell. So you just did a little performance for us. How do you feel it went?

**Charlotte:** I think it went pretty well. I really enjoyed opening the new store in Islington. It was really good. I really enjoyed it.

**Isabel:** So you played quite a few new songs, didn't you?

**Charlotte:** Yeah, yeah. I've got quite a few. I haven't played in a while so I've got loads of new songs that I haven't played.

**Isabel:** Is that the first time you've played your new ones?

**Charlotte:** Yeah, yeah. I did three new ones that I've never played before so that was exciting and they went well which was a relief.

**Isabel:** You also played quite a few covers. You did an Akon one, didn't you? Kings of Leon.

**Charlotte:** Yeah, yeah.

**Isabel:** Why did you choose to play those ones?

**Charlotte:** I think the Kings of Leon is like, everyone sort of knows it. It's famous so it's nice to get a familiar song in there.

**Charlotte:** An Akon is a bit of fun, really. It's not really my genre but I tried to make it a bit more acoustic.

**Isabel:** Good life, is he not?

**Charlotte:** Yeah, I think so.

[Your Kisses]

It's all too much
You're so cold to touch
You don't open up, open up.
Your kisses are not what I wanted
Your kisses are not what I crave
Your kisses may be a beautiful art

**Isabel:** So I'm sitting in the basement now with Elena. You just did a little performance for us. How do you feel about it?

**Elena:** Cool. I think it was good. It's my first performance so I actually stood up and played.

**Isabel:** So you usually sit?

**Elena:** Yeah, usually in the safety of a chair so I constantly thought I was about to fall over but I wasn't.

**Isabel:** So what are your plans for the future?

**Elena:** I'm on a songwriting course at the moment so, I don't know, I'm gonna finish that.

**Isabel:** Where are you doing that?

**Elena:** In Kilburn.

**Isabel:** Wow.

**Elena:** Yeah, the ICMP and yeah, that should be good. And then I don't really know, hopefully lots of gigs until I get something.

**Isabel:** And songwriting! 

**Elena:** And songwriting, writing songs, would be good.
