**Elena:** This is the first time I've been in America. It's exciting. I think we don't really know what to expect. Quite surreal at the moment. 

**Elena:** I don't know if anyone really, there's a lot of people that listen to our music, but it's been, we've had a really good reception at a lot of the gigs we've had so far, so very flattering for us to come over and people to know some of the words.

**Elena:** That's really good. I kind of want to now. I've got a really big head though. I have a really massive head. 

**Remi:** Do it, do it. 

**Elena:** It's not going to fit on my head.

**Remi:** Igor, do you want to try?

**Igor:** We all met in a music school in London and I and I were on the same course and we started doing music together about a year and a few months ago and recorded the first EP in my bedroom.

**Elena:** Music was the only thing I really enjoyed. I don't know, I wasn't great at school and I think music was something that I put all of myself into, so I just, naturally I think it was something I wanted to pursue.

**Igor:** Well I moved from Switzerland to London two or three years ago now and it was the moment where I thought, well now is the time to go and do what you want to do and see if it works and see if you can have fun and live from it and so far it's kind of worked pretty well.

**Elena:** I think lyrically it tends to be quite a lot about personal experiences and then some songs are just kind of written on moods so if it's kind of more about emotions and how they influence kind of the way that I write the lyrics I suppose so it could be anything to do with like a natural surroundings, so say it's like a really rubbish day then I might be in slightly depressive mood and that would influence the way I write or you know be it a person or nature or whatever it kind of, there's a lot of things I think that influence us.

**Elena:** I think the main thing for me is when sort of writing is to challenge myself I don't really, especially with you know because now we've kind of we've done the two EPs and we're sort of looking towards an album and it's I don't know I want to challenge our sound and just kind of expand it and experiment with kind of different styles as well I don't think we need to necessarily be contained into like a small box.

**Remi:** As long as I keep on having fun whenever I'm playing, if there's no fun anymore for me I just, I don't know, there's no point in doing it, might as well be a banker, I mean no offence to bankers but it's not what I want.

**Igor:** I think music is kind of the thing that excites me the most in life and that I feel really good about it.

**Elena:** I sort of also just think as long as I'm proud of the work then I think that's the main thing for me and then obviously if people like it that's like an added amazing bonus.
