**Georgie:** Kylie LaGrange for you on Brighton Festival Radio and I hope you're doing well this morning. It's all very exciting here in the Brighton Festival Radio Studio because the wonderful Daughter has come and she is going to play us some lovely music. And so, she's in the house. Hello, Elena. One sec, let me put your mic up.

**Elena:** Hello.

**Georgie:** How's things? How's Brighton Festival treating you? This is the first one as Daughter.

**Elena:** Yeah, we played yesterday. It went really well. So we've got two more shows today. So hopefully they go alright. I think we need some breakfast and tea and then we'll be okay.

**Georgie:** Yeah, some tea and toast and we're good to go.

**Elena:** Exactly.

**Georgie:** What do you make of Brighton as a place? Do you think the Great Escape is a special festival?

**Elena:** Yeah, it's really lovely. I came here last year and I had a really great time. So yeah, it's a great festival. 

**Georgie:** It's a good one.

**Elena:** And it's good to just see loads of new music as well.

**Georgie:** Who's kind of hot on your list if you had the chance to go and check out some bands?

**Elena:** Do you know, we haven't, but I really want to check out Bear's Den and Kyla LaGrange as well. So just, yeah, if I can get to check out a few, I will.

**Georgie:** Yeah, just played a bit of Kyla. You guys actually went to school together, didn't you?

**Elena:** Yeah, we did. We were in different years, but we went to the same old school.

**Georgie:** In Watford.

**Elena:** Yeah, woo.

**Georgie:** A hub of musical activity.

**Elena:** Exactly, yeah.

**Georgie:** So how have things been for you of late? You've released your beautiful new EP, His Young Heart. Are you pleased with the reaction to it?

**Elena:** Yeah, I'm really pleased. Everyone's been quite nice about it, which is good. No one's said anything horrible. Or if they have, it's been kept from me, so that's good.

**Georgie:** I'm sure no one could say anything horrible about it. Are you working on new material then? Are you starting to think about kind of putting an album together or another EP?

**Elena:** We're thinking about another EP, hopefully. Yeah, we'll see. It's early, but we want to put another EP out. 

**Georgie:** And as for now, what's going on in the world of Daughter? Are you doing lots of dates?

**Elena:** We're doing, yeah, more shows. To be honest, I can't remember when. I'm a very rubbish person with organisation, but we've got that thing called Facebook where we put stuff up on. But yeah, there's more gigs coming up.

**Georgie:** And in your sort of gigging, in the format of Daughter at a gig, you are joined by your sidekick, Igor, aren't you?

**Elena:** Igor, yeah, and Remi, our drummer now as well.

**Georgie:** Ah, you've got a drummer. When did he come on board?

**Elena:** He started, I think his first show was our EP launch, which is probably the most stressful. Throw him in at the deep end. So he's been playing, I think we've played about four shows together now. It's going really well.

**Georgie:** Is it sounding good? I imagine it probably is sounding really, really good because it just gives it that extra...

**Elena:** Yeah, I love having drums in. It's still a bit of a novelty, so I still find myself getting really excited when he comes in like, ah, drums! And then realise I should probably concentrate on my own playing rather than jamming to drums. No, it's good. It's really nice to have him on board.

**Georgie:** Do you have one of those surprise moments when you're kind of about to do a song and then it's building and you're like, ooh, there you are!

**Elena:** Go on, Remi! Yeah, definitely.

**Georgie:** Ah, exciting. You're going to play a track for us, aren't you? We'll have a bit more of a chat afterwards. What are you going to play?

**Elena:** I'm going to play Tomorrow, which actually isn't on the EP. 

**Georgie:** It's on the formal one, it's the one before.

**Elena:** Yeah, it's on the demos EP.

**Georgie:** And it's my favourite track off that. I had a moment where I was listening to it on repeat for about three weeks and then I realised I should probably not do this sometimes and I'll never be able to listen to it again. I'm very excited. I've had a break, so now I'm excited about hearing it.

**Elena:** Cool.

**Georgie:** So, live on Brighton Festival Radio 87.7 FM, this is Daughter.

[Tomorrow]

By tomorrow we'll be swimming with the fishes \
Leave our troubles in the sand \ 
And when the sun comes up \
We'll be nothing but dust \
Just the outlines of our hands 

By tomorrow we'll be lost amongst the leaves \
In a wind that chills the skeletons of trees \
And when the moon, it shines, I will leave two lines \
Just find my love, then find me 

But don't bring tomorrow \
Cause I already know \
I'll lose you \
But don't bring tomorrow \
Cause I already know \
I'll lose you \
I'll lose you 

By tomorrow I'll be left in the darkness \
Amongst your cold sheets \
And your shoes will be gone \
And your body warmth no longer beside me 

So don't bring tomorrow \
Cause I already know \
I'll lose you \
Don't bring tomorrow \
Cause I already know \
I'll lose you \
I'll lose you 

**Georgie:** Daughter live in session, that was absolutely gorgeous! So lovely, what were you kind of listening when you wrote that?

**Elena:** You know, I'm not really sure, I don't know, I sort of don't really, yeah I don't really think about it when I write, so it just comes out I think, but yeah, I don't know, very strange.

**Georgie:** What kind of place you have to be when you write?

**Elena:** Generally I write, I used to write a lot when I was drunk, and like is great, is kind of a good setting to be, just kind of when you come home, and you're a bit like wee! I used to sit in the dining room and it's really dark in there, and used to play in there, which sounds a bit strange, but yeah, I used to come with quite a few songs when being in that room.

**Georgie:** Three at the morning, let's write a song.

**Elena:** Exactly, yeah.

**Georgie:** And in terms of kind of new ideas and new material, do you think you have, have you got any idea where you are go with it, or it just kind to progress organically?

**Elena:** Yeah, I think it probably just naturally progress now, uh, but yeah, as I got Igor and Remi as well, I think they bring their own influence, arrangement and stuff, but I don't know where is going to go, at the moment is quite nice to not have plan and see what happens.

**Georgie:** Play shows and get the music heard, do you feel like there is a following now, a Daughter following?

**Elena:** I don't know, hopefully, I don't know really.

**Georgie:** Have you got a super fan yet?

**Elena:** No, I wish I did.

**Georgie:** It's like the Concords now. Comes to every show, wears the t-shirt everywhere.

**Elena:** Yeah, I think I'll probably pay my friends to come. Please come and pretend. Pretend you are my super fan.

**Georgie:** Amazing. So you're playing at the Great Escape again today?

**Elena:** Yeah.

**Georgie:** And tomorrow as well?

**Elena:** No, just two dates today, so Fishbowl in the afternoon and then Life tonight.

**Georgie:** What time are you on tonight?

**Elena:** Tonight I think we're on about 8.45.

**Georgie:** Quite a good time, and then you're going to get a chance to go and see some people afterwards.

**Elena:** We hope so. Yeah, I'd love to.

**Georgie:** Who's on your hit list?

**Elena:** Do you know, I don't even know. I need to read the manual. I've literally woken up like, where am I?

**Georgie:** It's like a bible.

**Elena:** It is. You have to be quite dedicated to go around and see everyone. They're all kind of in, yeah.

**Georgie:** Yeah, it's kind of dotted around.

**Elena:** It is, yeah.

**Georgie:** You've got to set up an itinerary.

**Elena:** Definitely. I know, I need to make a list right now.

**Georgie:** Yeah. Well Daughter, thank you so much for coming in and thank you for playing such a beautiful song.

**Elena:** Thanks for having me.

**Georgie:** And good luck with everything this year.
