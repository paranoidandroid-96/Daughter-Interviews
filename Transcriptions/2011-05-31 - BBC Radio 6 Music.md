**Lauren:** She is a brand new white hot talent that everybody's talking about. We love her. You may have heard her song Landfill, which has just been added to the 6 Music playlist, but we played it a lot on the show. And our very first session guest ever to be booked through Twitter. Welcome to the show, Daughter. How are you?

**Elena:** Hello! I'm good. Thank you. How are you?

**Lauren:** I'm very good. Thank you. So, listen, your name is is Elena, Elena Tonra. And you go by Daughter. You're only 21, right? 

**Elena:** Yeah.

**Lauren:** So tell me, how long have you been making music and how did you get started?

**Elena:** I've, really I've been making music for quite a while. I used to do solo gigs. And then I got these lovely guys to come down.

**Lauren:** We have Igor and Remi. Hello, boys. 

**Remi:** Hello!

**Lauren:** Remi's in a little cupboard. He's the drummer, he's been kept away. They're going to accompany you when you're in session. So you started off solo. 

**Elena:** Yeah.

**Lauren:** And then got these two, these pair. And now you've hooked up with Communion Records, right?

**Elena:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Lauren:** They've been putting you on. 

**Elena:** Exactly, yeah.

**Lauren:** And are they putting your new EP out?

**Elena:** We hope and we pray. 

**Lauren:** OK. So how would you describe your music? Because I've read that you you are very proud to wear clothes that that old people may well have died in, have a bowl cut that the Beatles would be proud of and to play songs that tell tales of ghosts, drowning lovers and setting fire to your insides for fun. Wow. It's quite a biogue.

**Elena:** Yeah, there was actually a song about setting fire to your insides. I don't play anymore. 

**Lauren:** Did that drop out of the set list?

**Elena:** It was a bit grim. I don't know. Well, I might bring it back.

**Lauren:** Maybe. See how it goes. There's plenty of time. So, I mean, it's an exciting point for you at the moment, because obviously, you know, 6 Music are playing your record. We really love you. But you're kind of getting lots of reviews and things. How do you feel that it's all going and where do you want it to lead to? What's what's the aim for you?

**Elena:** I'm just I'm just really happy people are listening, to be honest. And just wherever it goes, I'm sort of clueless at the moment. I'm just going to go with it and see what happens.

**Lauren:** Brilliant. Well, listen, I think where it's going to go next is that you're going to play for us. What are we going to hear from you?

**Elena:** We're going to play Landfill. 

**Lauren:** Oh, lovely.

[Landfill]

**Lauren:** Daughter live in session Landfill, which is, you can download that now, right?

**Elena:** Yeah, you can.

**Lauren:** Is that in the iTunes top 30?

**Elena:** I think it is.

**Lauren:** I think it is. Congratulations. That's exciting.

**Elena:** I know. It's pretty random. That's good.

**Lauren:** Rand-- but that's a thing young people say when they're happy, right?

**Elena:** I guess, yeah.

**Lauren:** That's good, she is happy. That's good. Talking about how you got started making music, and I was saying you wrote poetry, right, before you started writing songs. How did you start doing that?

**Elena:** I think I was about 13 or something, and I had this big book that my friend had given me and I thought I had to fill it with something. So, yeah, I just sort of wrote stuff down. I also can play an instrument, so I had to kind of make songs and just sing them like poems. Sing them out.

**Lauren:** And then just acapella.

**Elena:** It's really sad.

**Lauren:** And you ended up stealing a guitar from your big brother, right?

**Elena:** Yes, I did.

**Lauren:** And how is he about that now? Is he glad that it's all working out?

**Elena:** I think he's all right. He's got it back, because I managed to get one after.

**Lauren:** OK. 

**Elena:** He's got his back, at least.

**Lauren:** So, you kept it for several years. So, I still need this. It's all over famous. Oh, brilliant. Well, and we were also talking about the fact that, you know, you're associated with the Communion, that lot, that label and that bunch of musicians, and they've been really supportive of you. Are you on the new Communion CD for Mojo magazine?

**Elena:** Yeah, that was cool.

**Lauren:** That is a bunch of that stuff. Ben Howard, Johnny Flynn, Jay Jay Pistolet, Alessi's Art. I mean, they're all kind of a lovely bunch. Have they been instrumental in supporting you and keeping you making music and stuff?

**Elena:** Definitely. I mean, I met Kev really early on, and he was the first person that kind of said "come down to a Communion night and play". And it was just really like, as soon as you go in there, it's just like, oh, so many lovely, supportive people. So, yeah, that was really good. 

**Lauren:** And you're going to be playing their festival Bushstock, their festival in their Shepherds Bush, which is on Saturday.

**Elena:** This weekend.
 
**Lauren:** Good Bill, Cloud Control, Kill It Kid, Tree Top Flyers are playing.

**Elena:** Yeah.

**Lauren:** Anybody else that you know on the pill? Any other mates going to be down there?

**Elena:** Well, we hope. We hope so. I think The Staves are playing. Who else is playing? I don't even know. Who needs to know what's going on on Bill?

**Igor:** I mean, on...

**Elena:** On night? On day?

**Igor:** Well, I mean, St Stephen's Church, there's Fink.

**Elena:** Yeah, Fink's playing.

**Igor:** Marques Toliver. 

**Elena:** Lots.

**Lauren:** Lots?

**Igor:** King Charles.

**Elena:** There are lots-- I think Peggy Sue are playing, so hopefully I'll go down the road.

**Lauren:** Just Peggy Sue or attending pirates. I don't know how that...

**Elena:** Oh, yeah. There's no... Are there any pirates anymore?

**Igor:** No, they go by Peggy Sue now.

**Elena:** There's no pirates.

**Lauren:** Really? They got rid of the pirates? Oh, cruel. Apparently pirates... I read that pirates are called pirates because they had pirates and pirates are expensive and they brought pirates back because it was really bringing money back from overseas.

**Elena:** That's amazing.

**Lauren:** That's a massive cul-de-sac of a digression, so let's not go down there. Let's just talk about your live show. So you're playing Bushstock this weekend, you're doing a bunch of other gigs, which obviously are all online, but you're playing Proud Galleries, The Lexington, The Social. Any plans to go further afield in London?

**Elena:** We're going, actually, we're doing the Lounge on the Farm Festival.

**Lauren:** Oh, that'll be nice.

**Elena:** Just in Canterbury.

**Lauren:** Oh, lovely.

**Elena:** So that'll be nice. That'll be good. A bit of greenery.

**Lauren:** And will you be... Will that be nerve-wracking to head outside your hometown to play or...?

**Elena:** Well, we played in Brighton, actually, we did Great Escape, so we've had the car journey practice run with all of our gear in a really small car.

**Lauren:** Oh, really? No van yet?

**Elena:** Oh, no.

**Lauren:** OK

**Elena:** Punto (Fiat).

**Lauren:** A Punto. On to it in a Punto. I'm just imagining you hurtling up the motorway with that guitar neck sticking out of the window.

**Elena:** That was exactly how it was.

**Lauren:** It's an adorable image. Well, listen, I hope that's wonderful. And yeah, I just wish you a wonderful summer and that people out there are going to enjoy your music and check you out. If they want to do that, where's the best place to go, Elena? Should they look at the MySpace or Twitter or what?

**Elena:** You can look at all of them. Facebook.com forward slash ohDaughter.

**Lauren:** Yeah. O-H, isn't it?

**Elena:** O-H. Yeah, as in oh.

**Lauren:** Oh, Daughter.

**Elena:** Oh, not again.

**Lauren:** But I actually have to quickly ask you about the name. So why Daughter?

**Elena:** I just really like the word when it's written down. I've just got a love of G and Hs together.

**Lauren:** Parents must be very proud, though. Actually, she's named herself the thing that she is. That's awesome.

**Elena:** It's always nice to be a fact as well as a name.

**Lauren:** Yeah, that's good. OK, so listen, we're going to hear another tune from you now. This is from Daughter. What are you going to play?

**Elena:** We're going to play Candles.

[Candles]

**Lauren:** Daughter live in session. Elena, of course, with the Igor and Remi. Good skills in the drum with Remi's waving. You were playing the kick drum with your drumsticks there. 

**Remi:** I was!

**Lauren:** That was commitment to the role. Good man. That'd be good on the triceps. Listen, that sounded beautiful. Thank you so much for joining us.

**Elena:** Thanks for having us.

**Lauren:** And have a wonderful festival this weekend. We hope we see you again soon. You can catch Daughter at Bushstock this weekend. And then July the 8th is the date for Lounge on the Farm. I'm sure you knew that already. But if you want to look it up, there it is.
