**Darren:** Hey, it's Darren with 98.7 FM on the patio of the Pure Volume House presented by iHeartRadio joined all the way from the UK by Daughter. What's going on guys?

**Elena & Igor:** Hello!

**Igor:** Good and you?

**Darren:** Good, good. We're just talking briefly about, is it your first time in the States?

**Igor:** Kind of, yeah. As a fan, yes.

**Darren:** And first time in Austin?

**Elena & Igor:** Yeah.

**Darren:** What's your reaction to the madness down here in South by?

**Igor:** Whoa.

**Darren:** Yeah.

**Igor:** It's really cool.

**Elena:** It's pretty busy. There's a lot of people and a lot of things to see and yeah, it's very, it's crazy.

**Darren:** A little overwhelming.

**Elena:** A little overwhelming. Yeah. Exactly.

**Darren:** Have you, and you've played a handful of shows so far?

**Igor:** Yeah, we've played five shows. Last night was our last one.

**Darren:** Okay.

**Igor:** It was really good. We really enjoyed it.

**Darren:** Have you had a chance to get out and see any music of just as fans of music?

**Elena:** Yeah. I mean the queues are always slightly mental so we haven't really seen loads of gigs but last night actually we stayed at the venue that we were playing in.
The line up yesterday was just unbelievable. Like loads of our friends from London that were playing as well. So it's kind of like, it was really nice just to catch up and see people that we already love. So that was really good. We've kind of had a few sort of different gigs that we've been to. Like we went to see Theophilus London. Someone that...

**Darren:** Oh yeah, he's great.

**Elena:** Yeah, someone that we know kind of got us in.

**Darren:** Okay, yeah.

**Elena:** So we went to see him.

**Darren:** Having friends in the right places is important down here.

**Elena:** I know, yeah, it really does help. And yeah, I mean I think we were kind of, we were hoping to check out a few artists but it didn't really work out just because of when we were playing and what they were playing and stuff so...

**Darren:** Are you going to see your label mates tonight? Mumford and Sons playing on the big lawn?

**Elena:** We will be seeing them, yeah.

**Darren:** And actually just not too long ago we had a band that you played a show with in Philly, White Rabbits.

**Remi:** Oh, right!

**Igor:** Yeah, we played with them in Philadelphia and Washington, yeah.

**Darren:** How did you connect with those guys?

**Elena:** They were lovely. I don't think we really... It was kind of strange because when we turned up it was like they were always sound checking and then we were like kind of in the back. So it was kind of, they seemed lovely but you know when you kind of, all timings are kind of quite fast so you don't really get to really talk to people as much as...

**Darren:** As you'd like to probably, yeah.

**Igor:** We were still like just recovering from the massive time zone change so...

**Darren:** Yeah.

**Igor:** Check that you're jet lagged.

**Elena:** Yeah.

**Darren:** Now you guys have a couple of EPs out currently and you're working on the full length.

**Igor:** Yep.

**Darren:** Is that, are you guys doing that in the UK or are you going to...

**Elena:** Yeah, I think we're going to probably record everything for that in the UK. I mean we'd love to kind of travel around and sort of record different songs in different places but it's just kind of trying to find the time and the logistically how it'll work... 

**Igor:** And the places.

**Elena:** And the places. Yeah. 

**Elena:** I mean because Igor's kind of, your family live in Switzerland so I think that would be like an amazing... 

**Darren:** That would be great, yeah.

**Elena:**  ...place to write. I'm just inviting myself over.

**Igor:** Yeah, basically.

**Elena:** Let's go there. And then also Remi's from France so another place we could go and record. I'm from London so is not as exciting...

**Darren:** Well of course there's the massive USA. Yeah.

**Elena:** And the USA as well so it's kind of like...

**Darren:** Now what's the, do you already have songs put together? Are you constantly writing and constantly being creative musically?

**Elena:** We've got, we went, basically the way we write generally is very isolated, quite secluded so we can't really, we find it difficult to write say when we're on tour so we really need to be kind of in a dark room.

**Darren:** Yeah, oh really? Okay.

**Elena:** But yeah, it's just kind of, it's early stages at the moment but we've got like four or five new songs and we're kind of just hoping to keep writing new stuff because ultimately we'd love to have a brand, like all brand new albums where we can like all brand new songs. We've got some songs that we'd love to take from what they, because we've got kind of skeletal demo songs that have been written before that we'd quite like to kind of reinvent for the album and see if they fit but generally new stuff. 

**Darren:** And so for people who haven't heard your music or seen the live show, how would you guys describe it? 

**Igor:** Quite a few people describe it as an experimental folk or effed up folk.

**Darren:** Effed up folk, that's a good way to put it.

**Igor:** Yeah, no we quite, I mean...

**Darren:** So what makes it effed up? So what makes it experimental I guess? Because folk's familiar I think to most people, they can kind of grasp that. But what do you guys do to eff it up?

**Igor:** I think it's just the sounds, like we just like using gadgets and like just using instruments in different ways and it's like, yeah I think that's the experimental part. 

**Darren:** And are you guys just pretty straight forward with drums, bass, guitar or is it... 

**Elena:** We tend to swap things over a lot. So Remi plays like drums and bass at the same time on one song and then I play bass and then Igor plays bass and then I play... It's basically like swapping around stuff.

**Darren:** Oh, that's cool. I am trying to picture you playing bass and guitar at the same time. How do you do that?

**Remi & Elena:** Bass and drums.

**Darren:** Sorry, bass and drums, even harder.

**Remi:** Bass and guitar.

**Darren:** Even harder.

**Elena:** Bass and guitar would be incredible.

**Darren:** You could have one of those double guitars that they used to have back in the 80s probably. But how do you do that, drums and bass?

**Remi:** I don't know, I kind of keep it simple I guess.

**Elena:** With style.

**Remi:** Yeah, I'm not a bass player so I kind of try to do something that's going to sound good while playing drums. But yeah, everything is kind of simple. If you're looking for anything flashy, I'm not the kind of guy.

**Darren:** Well it sounds cool, I can't wait to see it. Any plans to come back to the States later this year? Probably in support of the record, I would imagine, when the new record is out.

**Igor:** Yeah, maybe earlier. There's no definite plans at the moment. We're happy to come.

**Elena:** Yeah, we just love the weather.

**Darren:** Yeah, right?

**Elena:** Such a change.

**Darren:** I know. From LA, we're not even used to it. Hot, humid, yeah. Well in the UK, you guys are in the middle of winter right now.

**Elena:** Yeah, it's the middle of winter all the time. So yeah.

**Darren:** Well maybe you'll make the States your home sometime.

**Igor:** Maybe, yeah.

**Darren:** Well thank you guys so much for stopping by. Looking forward to the new album. Get the EPs out available on iTunes right now. 

**Elena:** Yes.

**Igor & Remi:** Yep.

**Darren:** And hope to see you out in the States again very soon.

**Elena:** That would be great.

**Darren:** Thanks guys. 

**Igor:** Cool, great, thank you very much.
