*Huw's Maida Vale Session!*

[Youth]

Shadows settle on the place that you left \
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness \
Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time \
From the past \

**Huw:** Well, what a pleasure to welcome Elena, who is Daughter, to the show. How are you?

**Elena:** Really good, how are you?

**Huw:** I'm good. How was your time at Maida Vale recording this glorious session?

**Elena:** It was absoulutely lovely, we walked through the corridor, loads of just pictures, of previous people that had been there, this really legendary place. We went to the canteen and there was a picture of The Beatles getting their lunch, like in the canteen, I was like "this is amazing!"

**Huw:** Did you have exactly the same lunch as The Beatles?

**Elena:** I tried, I couldn't see what it was on the picture.

**Huw:** It hasn't changed since the sixties, the food there, so it's all good. So take us back to the beginning, when did you start making music?

**Elena:** I think I was about 13 or 14, I started writing, cause I couldn't play an instrument, so I just started writing songs and then singing them just around the house.

**Huw:** Oh really?

**Elena:** Then my brother left for uni and he left his guitar at home so I stole it and then tried to play it and then sort of taught myself.

**Huw:** Oh wow, so lucky didn't take his guitar to uni, otherwise you wouldn't have started?

**Elena:** That's true

**Huw:** Did you start gigging? Did you play a lot of open mic nights, that kind of thing?

**Elena:** We used to go down to this pub near where I live, and it was a bit of a dive, and then we all used to kind of go there with songs that we'd written, it was really nice, but that was the main place where we used to all hang out. 

**Huw:** Do you still go back there?

**Elena:** I think it's moved now, I don't think it's still there. 

**Huw:** Bulldozed. 

**Elena:** It might have been knocked down, yeah, exactly.

**Huw:** There'll be a plaque there one day, I'm sure. So when you play live, I still haven't seen you much to my shame, but what is the setup when you play live on stage?

**Elena:** So it's just the three of us, so it's me and Igor on electric guitar and his kind of effects, big effects thing, and then Remi on drums.

**Huw:** And you played the BBC Introducing Stage?

**Elena:** Yes

**Huw:** At Reading and Leeds?

**Elena:** And Leeds, yeah, it was absolutely amazing. I think we didn't really know what to expect and just kind of got up there and we had quite a big crowd actually at Reading, so it was really nice No, really not, really up for it and loud, which was great.

**Huw:** And playing kind of quieter music at what is a loud rock festival, were you intimidated at all before going on-site?

**Elena:** But yeah, really, I just didn't think people would listen to us to be honest, I don't know. But yeah, we got really good reactions, so it's surprising, but really good.

**Huw:** I think you can still hear your music on the Introducing set from Reading, which was best, Reading or Leeds?

**Elena:** Oh, I don't want to pick really.

**Huw:** I like your style though, it's better not to. And you're off on tour with Benjamin Francis Leftwich?

**Elena:** Yes.

**Huw:** Very soon indeed, so are you looking forward to that?

**Elena:** I'm really looking forward to that, especially because we don't get to go out of London much really. So it'd be nice just to kind of tour all around the UK and just see loads of places we've never been before. So it'd be lovely.

**Huw:** And to go on this tour, of course, you'll need time off from your day job. We won't mention where exactly, but it is a well-known department store.

**Elena:** It is.

**Huw:** Do they know that you're a musician?

**Elena:** Well, they do, but there's a bit of a sore subject because I haven't actually... I haven't really told them formally that I'm going on tour for a month. But I should have, I just forgot to.

**Huw:** So will you tell them the day that you're off on tour?

**Elena:** I quit, no, I don't know what I do. No, I'll have to just ask them very nicely.

**Huw:** I've just had an idea, it is a well-known department store, every gig that you play there's probably a store in town or nearby. You could do a shift.

**Elena:** That's really true.

**Huw:** You could do a few hours before a gig.

**Elena:** That would work out perfectly, wouldn't it?

**Huw:** Just a suggestion, just a suggestion. So what's the plan for the rest of the year? The tour's coming up and then will you be releasing more records?

**Elena:** Yeah, we've got a new EP actually, which will be coming out and then we're going to do a few shows in December. Introducing that EP and playing the new stuff live, which would be really fun.

**Huw:** Best of luck with it.

**Elena:** Thank you

**Huw:** And let's hear the last Maida Vale session track then. This is Daughter on Radio 1.

[Tomorrow]

By tomorrow we'll be swimming with the fish eyes \
Leave our trouble in the sun \
When the sun comes up \
