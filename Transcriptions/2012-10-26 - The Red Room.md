**Igor:** Hello, I'm Igor. 

**Elena:** I'm Elena. 

**Remi:** And I'm Remi. 

**Igor:** And we're Daughter.

**Elena:** Yay!

**Remi:** Boop, boop!

**What decade of music would you want to be transported to?**

**Remi:** Late 60's. 

**Elena:** 70's. 

**Igor:** 90's.

**What's your guilty pleasure?**

**Igor:** Sushi.

**Elena:** Erm, go. I don't know.

**Remi:** Any sort of food, but with a tendency of eating a lot of chocolate.

**Elena:** Staring at people. Like if I'm in a coffee shop or an airport. Just staring at people. I sound really weird. And that's probably why I think that's quite fun. Just watching people. I like it.

**Remi:** The internet.

**Elena:** That's your guilty pleasure?

**Remi:** Well, watching videos of cats on YouTube. 

**Elena:** Oh, yeah.

**Remi:** Or babies laughing.

**Elena:** Babies laughing.

**Remi:** That's a good one.

**What sound or noise do you love?**

**Elena:** Erm, applause.

**Igor:** [unaudible]

**Remi:** That's a good one.

**Igor:** The sound of the ocean waves crashing.

**Remi:** Erm, metronome, probably.

**Elena:** I think I should change mine.

**Igor:** Feedback.

**Remi:** Oh my god!

**Elena:** That's the one I hate.

**What sound or noise do you hate?**

**Elena:** Booing and feedback.

**Remi:** Silence after a song. When people don't really know if they should clap or not.

**Igor:** Construction work.

**Elena:** Yeah.

**What profession would you choose if you weren't a musician?**

**Elena:** I think if I was any good at science, which I'm not, I probably wouldn't have been a forensic scientist or something. Or a criminologist or something. Something grim and interesting.
Something like that.

**Remi:** Erm, if I wasn't a musician, I would probably, it would still, I don't know, if I was not a drummer, it would still have to do with the music industry I think. Erm, sound engineer or maybe anything in PR? Online stuff? Online PR? Anything? Yeah.

**Igor:** I like literature, so maybe I'll study that.

**Elena:** Would you be a writer?

**Igor:** Maybe

**Elena:** Are you going to be a writer? Are you going to be a serious writer?

**What's the one thing other than your instrument that you bring to every show you play?**

**Igor:** What'd you bring?

**Remi:** A hat.

**Elena:** How do you mean that? This ring, generally, I don't know, I seem to always munch on one all the time, so I think now it's like a lucky charm. It's the idea, yeah.

**Remi:** Erm.

**Elena:** And a capo.

**Remi:** Drum keys.

**Elena:** Oh no, that is a new word.

**Remi:** [unaudible]

**Elena:** It's attached to it.

**Remi:** Yeah, okay.

**Elena:** It's cheese.

**What's your favorite artist that no one has heard of that everyone should know?**

**Igor:** Evenings. It's, I think I got it from so many years, so I can't remember, that is living in New York, and it's really good.

**Elena:** Erm, for me, I think Bear's Den, I'm like some of our friends-

**Remi:** Damn, that was mine!

**Elena:** -[laughter] and I think they're really brilliant, so I would say check them out.

**Remi:** Definitely. Lovely people as well.

**What do you remember about your first concert experience?**

**Elena:** I remember it was when people used to smoke in pubs, because they didn't have a smoking ban, and it was like a haze, and there was beer all over the carpet, it was like really dingy. I think that was my first gig experience, and it wasn't totally pleasant, but I remember it.

**Remi:** I remember it was in a, I was doing a drum solo for my music school, and it was my first gig, and I really thought, I was so stressful, I thought it was going to be my last gig. Stressful.

**Igor:** Erm, I don't know, I don't really remember my first gig. There we go.

**Do you have any pre show rituals?**

**Elena:** Erm, not really, we don't really have much of a...

**Igor:** Generally we drink alcohol.

**Elena:** Generally, yeah, a beer.

**Remi:** I kind of warm up vocally.

**Igor:** What are we going to need today?

**Elena:** Try not to freak out, and erm, try and warm up slightly.

**Igor:** [unaudible]

**Elena:** Yeah, I think that to keep occupied, I think that we generally keep occupied before we need to go on, so we don't think about the fact that we need to stand in front of people for half an hour or more.

**Elena, Igor & Remi:** Thank you, bye bye.
