[Landfill]

**Marcus:** That's London singer-songwriter Elena Tonra, better known as Daughter, and the track's called Landfill, which is off this EP, His Young Heart. Tell me about that, Elena.

**Elena:** It's a four-track EP, and we recorded it, me and Igor, who's my live guitarist, we recorded it in his bedroom, really.

**Marcus:** Tell me about Communion, which is a platform for musicians set up by, among others, Ben Lovett from Mumford and Sons, and they've sort of taken you to some extent under their wing.

**Elena:** Yeah, definitely. Kev, who's one of the co-founders, probably about three years ago, like really quite a long time ago now, and he offered me a gig at Communion Night in the Notting Hill Arts Club.

**Marcus:** OK.

**Elena:** So he started off there, and yeah, he's really been just always really supportive, and also Ian Grimble, he's really supportive as well, so it's just nice, it's nice to have people around that are, you know, willing you on, sort of thing, so.

**Marcus:** Communion has had sort of children, including, not only Mumford and Sons, but sort of Laura Marling and Noah and the Whale and Jay Jay Pistolet, who's now in The Vaccines, lots of people like this have, I mean, I don't think they owe their success entirely to the Communion Night, but they've come through there and done really well, and Communion now has a label as well.

**Elena:** Yeah.

**Marcus:** Is that something which you would consider releasing on?

**Elena:** Definitely, yeah, I would definitely consider that, I think that it's nice to find people that you trust very well, like music is such a kind of weird thing to put with other people, you know, it's a bit scary to think, oh, I'm going to just work with someone I don't know, you know, so I've never done that, and I think to have Communion, I know, you
know, I trust them and know them and love them, so for me that's, it's definitely a big consideration, an option.
