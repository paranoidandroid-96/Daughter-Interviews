London based band Daughter are often described as playing folk rock but their new album “Not To Disappear” is a much heavier affair to their debut album, “If You Leave”. Daughter’s guitarist Igor Haefeli took some time to tell Sam Steen all about the new record and the band’s evolution.

It has been three years since Daughter released their debut album "If You Leave." The album put the band on the map and the critical acclaim it received was well deserved.

Since then they have also released a really interesting shoe gaze cover of Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky”, but their latest effort, “Not To Disappear” is quite a different beast altogether.

Listen to Sam Steen's full interview aboveElena Tonra’s delicate vocals remain but there’s a new edge to them too, musically it’s also darker and heavier than their earlier work, the change according to the band’s guitarist Igor Haefeli, is a natural result of the work they’ve been doing over the last few years. “We ended up touring for a good two years and that really influenced how we came back in to the studio and how we approached the new record. We wanted to bring the kind of rockier sound that we had on stage to the record. It was a very different thing. We were writing in a different way, we went in to a proper studio where we just recorded the whole record so there were quite a few different elements to the process.”

One of the starkest differences between “Not To Disappear” and “If You Leave” is the lyrics. Elena Tonra has never been afraid of singing about personal things, but where the debut often dealt with the well worn themes of heart break and love, their sophomore effort touches on the issues of dementia and mental health.

Listen closely and listeners are taken on a heartbreaking and frustrating journey but the strength of the album is that the songs never wallow in this melancholia, much of which is down to Igor’s input. “In terms of the origin of a song it really depends from song to song. Some come from Elena having an idea at home or on tour and then building on that if she shares it with us but sometimes it could be Elena and me in a room, trying different musical ideas and then if she gets inspired she’ll look through her lyric book and see if anything connects with the vibe of the music that we’re making”, he explained.

“A song like 'To Belong' started like that but a song like 'Doing The Right Thing' was very much something where Elena had an idea for quite a while and it definitely changed a good amount to what it was originally. There’s always this push and pull between us where we maybe feel like the song should be going in different directions to each other so finding a place where everyone is happy is a big thing," said Igor.

Easier said than done when the subject matters are often so personal and heartfelt, particularly in the case of "Doing The Right Thing", a song that deals with the loss of self that dementia brings, it must have been very difficult to compromise on it’s direction.

“It’s definitely a tough one”, said Igor, “I think it’s just about recognising that when you start making art it instantly, as soon as you share it, is not exclusively what you you intended it to be. Even people who are not participating in the creation of a piece of art but simply see it and integrate it in their own way, for them it could have a different meaning to what the artist intended.”

It’s not just the band’s sound that has evolved either. The group have also developed their live show to incorporate many new visual elements, “We’re definitely working really hard on that and we hope to surprise a few people and stuff but it’s always depends of the venue and the size of the stages we’re playing but we really want to make it a visual and sonic experience so we’re very excited about that”, Igor explained.

The band's sound on the latest album was influenced heavily by their live shows in support of the debut record but fans can expect further development as Daughter take their new songs on the road.

“It’s a totally different challenge by that point, and I find that for me it’s phase two of the songs. Phase one is painting the picture and getting a frame but then live is about making sense of it all... I’m really like, 'shit I really want to record the album again because it’s sounding even better live than it did on record”, because we spend a lot of time and dedicate a lot of effort to try and make it even better and more powerful and impactful.”

Plenty to look forward to then when Daughter take to the den Atelier stage on Sunday October 16. Tickets for 28 euros are still available on the website: [atelier.lu](http://www.atelier.lu/Upcoming-Shows/Daughter)
