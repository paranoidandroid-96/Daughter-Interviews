Is there a story to the kids on The Wild Youth EP?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Yes! It's me (Elena) and my brother when we were mini people! The photo was taken by my grandmother at an adventure playground! There is a series of pictures from that day of us looking SO excited about everything! :) I think the thing I love most about that picture is the way my brother is grabbing hold of my neck! (and the "fun session" stickers!) E x

Do you guys like CHVRCHES?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Aside from being exceptionally good at their craft, they are some of the nicest people we've met :) . IH



SnowLeppard:
Hey, I'm a huge fan! You've played some cool venues such as churches and cathedrals, is there anywhere (however ridiculous) you'd like to play but haven't yet? Thanks for all the beautiful music!
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Hello! I've always really wanted to play in a cave! Or deep in a forest somewhere! That would be cool. But yes, we do love to play in beautiful venues! We played in a cemetery once! That was pretty spoooooky! E x 



gerryt32:
Hey guys, big fan! I saw you play at Massey Hall last week with The National and you were amazing. I was a bit disappointed that I didn't get to hear my favourite song (Landfill) though!  

I just wanted to ask how you got involved in the sessions for your new EP with Joe Duddell? I can't wait to hear it!
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	We got introduced to Joe at Festival n°6 (in North Wales) and did a small session with him. We really liked it and wanted to do something special for our 4AD session so we asked him if he was up for working with us again. R



calumhawk:
have you heard of [Keaton Henson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeWWFIwcwhw)? would you ever consider doing an incredible collaboration?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Yes! I'm a big fan :) E x



xMGMT:
1) You've played shows all around the world, where have you enjoyed playing the most? 

2) What's the strangest thing a fan has given you?  

3) You guys have been touring a lot, are you looking forward to having some time to just relax at home?  


My friend Janne loves you guys but couldn't make it to this AMA, it would make her week if you said hi to her!
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	"Hey Janne sorry you can't make it. But see you soon I hope!" 1) There aren't any locations that I disliked but some were pretty special, such as The Hollywood Forever Cemetery last summer. 2) Nothing strange but some really nice things such as a book including a lot of letters from some of our fans from around the world. 3) Time off is good, but after a couple days I want to be doing something again, or feel like I need Brian our Tour Manager to tell me what my day will consist of, or what time I can go for lunch :) R.



pawel2208:
Why are you look so gloomy and depressed on video for air studio live sessions? Everything is ok ;) ?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	ahaha my mom as always told me (eversince I was a child) I should smile more on stage. Maybe I should listen to her more... R



haziqzaq:
Hmm, so you said ask anything...
1) What is the weirdest thing anyone of you has done on tours?
2) It's your last performance ever. Which song would you perform, and why?
3) Do you like sloths?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	1) We almost drove in a prison once because our GPS took us there when (when it was meant to take us to our hotel). 2) Celebrations by Kool &amp; The Gang, cause we might as well finish with some party. 3) I swear my girlfriend sends me at least 1 Buzzfeed Sloth relation link per day. R

[deleted]	How did it feel when you realized you guys had &quot;made it big&quot;?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	I still don't think we've "made it big". We're lucky to have been around the world a couple times, but when I see bands such as the National, you realise that these guys are total pros. R(emi)



AlmondFlash:
Favourite albums of 2014 so far?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	The War on Drugs - Lost in the Dream. R



[deleted]:	d-pen
what kind of bass do you guys always have on stage? i love that thing.

who is the guy that always plays live with you guys but is not "in the band"?

im really glad to see that you guys are receiving a lot of attention lately, you definitely deserve it. when we saw you in philly it was incredible.
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	It's an old DanElectro U2(?) Bass that Igor bought off a friend a few years ago.
And Luke is the guy on stage playing everything that we couldn't possibly play live as a 3 piece... And he is a lot friendlier than a backing track ;) R



Buttermynuts:
Hey there. I have never heard of you before. What should I check out of yours first?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Our cover of Hakuna Matata. Take care. IH



Irubingu:
Hello!, i am a big fan of yours, i am from Mexico, my name is Irving and i bought your album from the UK, I just wanted to ask, if you have in mind coming to Mexico some time? i know Mexico has bad rep- but its a fine place if you find a nice place to play. 
thank you very much. (i apologize for bad english)

	>	weareDaughter:
	>	I have heard from some friends that Mexico had some of the best audiences they had ever played so i would really love to play there! 



zipzipzipzip:
You were the highlight of Glastonbury for me last year and you all looked a little surprised at the reaction, was there a time or a gig where you thought that you are really connecting with people and the band could go on and do big things?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Thanks! We never thought about it in terms of big things but there's always a bit of amazement at witnessing people connect with the things we try to express both musically and lyrically. I can't think of a specific moment because we still really feel surprised about it. I hope we can keep that approach for as long as possible! IH



Blew_away:
Hey Daughter, I am a big fan. I love how you guys create sonic atmospheres over pretty simple lines. Your songs really draw a listener in and then keep them with outstanding lyrics. Your stuff really is just beautiful.

My question: What is your writing and creative process like? Music or lyrics first? And how do you keep pushing yourselves in different directions to keep from being static in your writing? 
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	A bit of both. Listening to lots of different music really helps. Life also just pushes you in different directions and that translates in whatever we are creating I guess. IH



dquiaot:
Coachella was my first exposure to Daughter.  I walked into into Mojave not knowing what to really expect.  From the first song (Still), my heart dropped.  Being in that moment seemed so surreal, so perfect.  I just wanted to leave a comment, in thanks.  It made me realize these moments come so far and few between, and it was a pleasure to experience it with the people in the Mojave tent that Sunday evening.  All my love from San Diego, CA.
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Thank you! IH 



gerryt32:
What was the best food you've ever had on tour? Where was it?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	We were in Tokyo, and we were walking up this street and came across a tiny door... we were wondering what it was so we had a sneaky peek inside and found it was a restaurant, and people waved us in! It felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland! haha We had the most amazing Sashimi! It was just such a random discovery! I love moments like that! E x



ozthewanderer:
We were all stunned by the Air Studio performances. How was that experience, playing with an orchestra in such a beautiful atmosphere?

[deleted]	What gig were you guys most nervous about? The first gig ever? The first gig as a headliner? The first gig at a festival? The first gig oversea? The first gig in another continent?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Every gig ever in the entire world :) IH
			>	weareDaughter:
			>	I was pretty nervous for our first headline show. Or any kind of homecoming shows, because all of my musician friends are there and they can play a lot better than I am. R

I saw you live at the Eden Project with sigur ros, and you guys were amazing. What's your favourite sigur ros track?

	>	weareDaughter:
	>	I like of their songs, but surprisingly i have never been good at remembering the names.... I know all the lyrics tho :) R
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	It's hard to choose and as I just said I don't like favourites. But "Gong" is definitely up there! IH



IraqYourWorld:
What's your favorite song by The National? Seeing you both tonight!
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	I always tear up a bit during "pink rabbits". See you there! IH



steph313:
Hello Daughter! I am new to this chat thing lol, I just want to say your performance last May at The Troubadour in Los Angeles was heavenly! I got the opportunity to meet all three of you and I am super grateful that I did, you guys signed my poster and I took it with me for my first year of college, big fan here!! Are there any more plans to perform in LA again this year? It's been almost a year, what are you guys up to? Missed you guys at Coachella  
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Hi Steph, thanks for saying such nice things! It was great to meet everyone after the show. There aren't any plans to play in LA soon. Our last show was at the Wiltern in October last year. Maybe you missed that one? Take care. IH



[deleted]: xSpin
Really big fan! Are you guys planning on doing a U.S Tour anytime soon? I would live to see you guys live.
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	We're currently in the US supporting the National. In terms of our tour... I'm not sure.. we'll probably have to write more music first so we don't come and just play the same songs over and over again. R



superchilango:
I feel your music is very cinematographic, what are your favorite movies?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	"Pan's Labyrinth" is always so wonderful to watch, "Amour" made me cry so much. I saw "Rear Window" the Hitchcock film really recently, I'd never seen it before, I thought it was beautiful. "Let the right one in" (The original) is amazing. "La Haine" was a favourite of mine when I was growing up. Igor showed me "Rust and Bone" last week, which was beautiful... I don't know! I have too many favourites! haha! E x 



cassmonster:
Hey guys! huge fan, I was just wondering where did the name Daughter come from? Is there any deep meaning to the name? thanks :)
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Elena infamously said to Lauren Laverne she likes having "g" and "h" next to each other ;) . IH



richardyeah:
What reverb pedal does Igor mostly use? Thanks!
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Eventide Space! I use it on every single song live. IH



[deleted]:	meepmup
I first heard of you guys where you were announced for Iceland Airwaves 2012 and I was obsessed for months before you came. You're show in Frikirkjan was incredible. 

I don't really have a question, but I have to say, and my friends agree, that we can listen to your record over and over. I always want to listen after 4-5 month hiatus, and when I put it on I'm always afraid I'll get sick of it. ....has yet to happen. Keep up the fantastic music!
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Iceland Airwaves was so much fun! We had a great time over there. It was so windy we weren't allowed outside the city though :( . IH



Arbeitessenheit:
Hi! I am a huge fan of your albums and EPs, but I am equally floored whenever I hear your covers and mashups (such as Get Lucky and the Perth/Ready For the Floor). My question is how do you approach the challenge of adapting someone else's work to your style, and do you have any plans to do more covers in the future? Also, please come back to Boston! Can't wait to see you live sometime!
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Hey! Thanks a lot. We like to be pretty loose about the original material. Elena also wants a song that she can relate to somehow even if it's not the original meaning of the song. IH



[deleted]:	Luckers92
[deleted]	Hey guys, big fan here! I saw you guys at Pukkelpop in Belgium last year. You guys didn't have your own instruments but you still put on an amazing show! I thought that was really awesome!

My question is, did you guys find your old instruments back or did you have to acquire new ones? Did they get stolen or were they just misplaced?

	>	weareDaughter:
	>	WE DID! It was so scary walking on stage without any of our gear and not knowing if people were gonna be understanding or stick around. But you guys were amazing and made us feel like we were playing a normal show. R

[deleted]	You signed my shoe at Liverpool Anglican cathedral... just wanted to say that it was quite easily the best live music I have ever seen :)

	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Thanks. How is the shoe btw? R
		>	gizastella:
		>	http://imgur.com/jv3eUN2
			Bit more battered since you signed it, but it shows that I wore it with pride! Started a few conversations! Who are your guys favourite bands?





richardyeah:
The first few times I saw you guys, Elena started laughing half way through a song. WHAT WAS SO FUNNY I MUST KNOW ps. my fave was at The Great Escape when Igor played the Xylophone and messed it up
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Yup. You can see why I gave that up pretty quickly ;) IH



ynevdm:
dogs or cats?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Dogs! all the way! I like the small silly looking guys the best!
...Cats know too much - they freak me out. E x

Continue to make great music, i love you, Cheers from Indonesia ♥ 
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Thank you we'll try :) I hope we can make it to Indonesia some day! R



minty901:
do you consider yourselves "post-rock"? and who are your favourite other post-rock bands? i hear some sigur ros influence.
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	I think we definitely have "post-rock" influences. I always relate that genre to mostly instrumental bands where lyrics aren't as prominent as in our music though. Regarding the Sigur Ros influence, does my bow playing have anything to do with that ;) . IH



[deleted]:	smallgute
[deleted]	how did you come to getting to know your sound so well? do you plan on changing it in the future?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Our sound is a constant work in progress. Even on tour I constantly tweak my sounds. We've been working on new songs recently and there's a lot of stuff which is quite different from the old stuff. It's very early days, so it's just about being creative and exploring new horizons. I can't vouch for what the album will be like yet but I think it's good to be interested in pushing yourself towards other sounds than your own. Your art and craft will only become stronger in my opinion. IH



elliesings:
Hey Daughter! I'm Laura, and I met you guys last summer when you opened for The National. I wish there was a way to thank you for what your music has done for me. I've been listening to the Air Studios songs a ton since they've been released. How was your experience working with Joe Duddell?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Hey Laura! :) Thank you for listening to the Air songs! It was such a great experience! We had worked with Joe before at a festival and we enjoyed it so much we wanted to do it again. We were lucky enough to included more musicians this time, and they are all so talented! It was really exciting to be a part of! E x



[deleted]:	M0arty
[deleted]	Who are your idols?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Jeff Buckley was a big idol for me growing up! It was the first time I heard music that felt like it melted my brain it was so great! haha E x



Mystery-Mouse:
Hey there! I don't have a question for you, but I just wanted to say that I love you infinitely. Your music means a lot to me. **Thank you for existing.** (Btw, Remi, you signed my shoe too, in November last year (in Belgium), thank you for that!) 
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Why do I keep on signing shoes; i need to stop that! :) R



richardyeah:
What's it like touring America? It seems like it'd be the coolest thing to do ever, but I don't know if you're all as stupidly excited by American culture as me.. 
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	There's definitely a vibe over here you won't get anywhere else in the world. We're always excited to come back. There is a lot to discover! IH



elliesings:
Igor, I just want to say that I always enjoy watching you play, especially during Home. It seems like that's one of the songs you guys get into the most! 
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Thanks! The build-up definitely gets to me each time. IH



[deleted]:	Forced_In
Hello! Massive fan. Saw you guys in Norwich back in October.

First of all, I just wanted to say thanks for making cool music. You guys are awesome. You're so humble and understated when on stage and always seem to be genuinely thankful to everyone for coming to the show. 

Have you been writing any new songs whilst on tour? Or will you wait until after the tour has finished to try and come up with new stuff?

	>	weareDaughter:
	>	We wait for the tour to be finished. Speaking for myself, I like to have a bit more space to take the time to experiment and find the right sounds. It can be sometimes a slow process aswell as boring for the others. I do like to mess with my laptop on tour from time to time when inspiration strikes though. IH 



AndreaCamachoY:
Where did you meet each other? I'm curious.
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	I London, we were in College together. R



Denageelen:
I just wanted to say thank you to Elena for literally saving my life with her songs. i love you, you are my biggest inspiration and without you I would've never come this far. Xox dena. please respond it would mean the world
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Thank you! So lovely to talk to you, It means so much to me that you enjoy our music, and it's beautiful to think that thoughts I've had and written down when i'm feeling alone can share a meaning with someone else's thoughts and feelings. I hope everything is going well for you!
love, E x

Francis21:
Hey guys! Huge fan here in Toronto and have seen all your shows here over the last 2 years, and tremendously happy at the success you are seeing. Spreading your music is what makes me happiest - and the lyrics are just so achingly melancholic it makes me love you all even more. 

I recently paid to see you 3 nights in a row with the national at massey hall in Toronto. You guys are incredible. 

However, on Friday night Remi said "thank you" after playing a song, and I yelled out "YOURE WELCOME, IGOR!" from the front row. You quickly said "my name is remi after another song" and I felt bad about it. I just wanted to apologize for this. It was a brain cramp. Just tell me it's all going to be okay please. 

Keep it up, and I hope to meet you all at your next show in the T-DOT! 


	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Hahaha. Wouldn't be the first time we got confused. Thanks for coming to the shows early and supporting us every time we make it over to your amazing city! Best, IH



elliesings:
This is a question for Elena! When you were first starting out as a solo act, did you find yourself getting discouraged a lot? How have you grown since then? I'm currently a music major at a university in NY, and I find myself always comparing myself to other musicians who have more experience than me. I try not to let it get to me, but it's hard when you're surrounded by people with the same goals as you. Thanks for taking the time to talk to us! Xx
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Hello! When i was first starting out I was playing mainly at nights where a lot of my friends were hanging out, so that's probably the main reason I had the courage to perform in the first place, it was because there were people there I knew and felt support from. I have friends who are INSANE at guitar, actually one friend called George taught me how to play, and as much as i wish i could be as good as him at guitar, I just appreciate how talented he is, but i know that our brains are very different. I went to a music school where everyone had similar goals, but everyone there was making different music and writing about their own individual thoughts. There will never be anyone who will think the same way that you do, or that expresses themselves the same way as you, So really when you are surrounded by other musicians the best way to think about it is not like a competition, but as a learning experience where you can be inspired by other people and then channel that into what you are working on! Good luck with everything! E x 



sirjackmangik:
hello daughter:) i love your music so much. i especially love your sound. drenched with beautiful large hall reverb, just the way i like it. my question is for Igor. what was it like producing the album? was this the first time producing an album, or have you done this before with other musicians? were there any moments where you were "stuck" or did everything go smoothly during the production of If You Leave? also what is your inspiration for your music and atmosphere(the chilling reverb on vocal tracks, guitar tracks, etc), also, what pedals do you use. what is your favorite and most use when on a gig? 
  
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Hey! That's a lot of questions but I'll go for the production ones. I'm really just an amateur with a passion for music and I've been learning as I go along. We didn't want to go down the traditional route of having a hot producer make a record for us. We wanted to do it, we wanted feel like it really came from us and just us. I guess I was the one with the most experience (and the biggest mouth) to helm that side of things. Things were definitely not smooth but none of us would have wanted it otherwise. I could have probably spent 3 more years working on it but I really appreciate now how it documented that time in our "career". It feels right and we were blown away by the response. Since then I've worked on a track with Kyla La Grange for her new album and production is definitely a side of things I want to explore more in the future. IH

There is a roast chicken in the oven, it's warm so you decide to eat outside. After that you take a nap while the Tour de France is on tv in the background. Wake up 10 minutes from the end (when the exciting stuff happens). Then later you go to a Dire Strait reunion concert. ahahah Remi.

_Azirov:
How have relationships with former friends and family change after touring so often? Do some people try to get closer to you now that the band is flourishing?

Thanks for doing the AMA! I'm always curious of bands perception and experience with SXSW.  Did you enjoy doing the festival and did you get a good value/exposure/coverage as a result of doing it?  Any favorite part of the festival (other than sleeping after it's over)?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	SXSW = crazy times. We only played 5 shows in a week which is nothing compared to what some artists and bands do. The weekend got a little too rowdy for us. The streets are packed. The start of the week is much nicer. Most people are there for the music and having a good time. Austin is such a cool city aswell. I couldn't really tell you what exact impact it had but we didn't definitely enjoyed it. Playing at Willie Nelson's Ranch while the sun was setting was definitely a highlight. IH

Hi Elena, Remi, and Igor. Thanks for doing an AMA. I saw you guys in Atlanta and it was by far the best concert I've been to. 
What are your plans for new music? 

http://m.imgur.com/6jUVbWm
P. S. I drew this portrait of Elena (which I heard was given to you as a part of a fan project) and I'm planning on drawing Remi and Igor as well. I really can't express how grateful I am for your music and how accepted it's made me feel. 
So thanks for everything. I love you guys and everything you've done x

He showed me a video of Max Roach doing a solo using just a HiHat and it was amazing. You end up seeing your drums differently when you have less stuff. (a rim can become some sort of cymbal; a floor tom can be a kick...etc) R



HeraldZoid:
Igor, I'd love to know what your pedalboard looks like and how you get those amazing walls of sound during live performances. My girlfriend and I saw you guys play in Toronto during the summer and I was absolutely blown away by your huge sound during the climax of each song.

Also, who are your biggest influences, musical or not?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Delay, reverb and a strong right hand :) . Sometimes you can forget that your playing affects the sound as much as the pedals. I love movies, particularly the cinematography side of it. It helps my inspiration and to visualise sound. IH

When you played at Lincoln hall last year, you mentioned that you liked the pizza and the pizza. What else did you like about Chicago now that you're back again??

How did you get the idea to use a double bass bow on a guitar/electric bass?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Jonsi &amp; Jimmy Page. I like the double bass bow better than the cello bow though. I feel like it helps the guitar sound a little more like an actual cello. IH 



VK18:
I just think you guys are absolutely brilliant. What a piece of advice would you offer up for a young musician trying to make it?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Be truthful, don't do something for the sake of doing it. Trust your instincts and persevere. IH
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Don't try to make it. Enjoy doing what you are doing and with a bit of luck (and a lot of work) you can "make it". Don't be scared to be involved in a few different projects/bands, you never know what can happen. Someone you played with a couple years ago, might have become the biggest musician on the planet and is looking for someone to play with him... and BOOM he remembers all the fun time he had on stage with you... And always be nice to everybody (your crew, venue crews even if they aren't nice to you). R

Quick question before I head off to sleep (2.45AM here). If you had not become a musician, what do you think you'll end up doing instead?
	>	weareDaughter:

toadling17:
So I've seen you guys live twice now and you're phenomenal (I mean, your album/EPs are anyway), hands down my favorite live shows to go to, so thank you for making your live shows so enjoyable and brilliant! 

As for the question, do you guys have another album planned or in the works at all? Or are you guys just touring at the moment?



steph313:
Igor, what is your favorite color? plz say its orange haha.... jk

ConstantConversation:
Hi Elena! I met you last summer when you performed at the Great Hall in Toronto; my friend and I were trying to get last minute tickets, and your show was phenomenal!

I have a two-part question:
1) I've noticed you are incredibly shy--on stage you are very quiet and don't talk super often. Does your love of singing cancel out your stage fright, or do you find performances to be very difficult?
2) When you cover other songs (specifically pop song such as "Get Lucky" and "Perth/Ready for the Floor"), do you have a process to make sound like a Daughter song?

Anyway, I love love LOVE your music and I hope you swing by Montreal soon!



lailaruffin:
What artitst(s) inspired you to start your musical career? 
Also where can I buy some daughter apparel to support my favorite band!
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Probably my drum teacher, just because he it hadn't been him, I probably would have stopped playing when I was in my teens. But after moving to London I got into Folk/ Alternative a lot more and got obsessed with Laura Marling's music. R




psychosantana:
Hello guys! i'm a big fan and I just wanna say thanks for the amazing show you did at the Theatre Corona! You should come more often in Montreal!! 

I suffer from depression and I listened to your music when i was at the hospital... so thank you, you kinda..save my life with your music. Keep up the good job like this you guys are full with talent! 

by the way Elena you are reeaaaally cute and sweet i love you :))

BIG LOVE, A.M
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	 (and coming to the show!) Learning that our music has helped people in their darker moments has been something really powerful for me. Thank you for sharing. All the best, IH



The_Radish_Spirit:
Will Igor marry me? I'm a dude, but as long as he's okay with it, I'm okay with it.



elliesings:
Remi, I followed your tumblr when you had it for a while, and I was so sad to see you deleted it! I really enjoyed your photography. Is there any other place you share the photos you take?
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Oh wow thanks. I'm working on it. It should be ready in a couple weeks hopefully and then I'll share the photos once more. Glad you liked it. R



richardyeah:
Last one, I swear: What would be your biggest song-writing tip(s) on guitar? Tunings/scales/theory/less theory/effects? 
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	All of those but none of those. It all depends on what you're trying to achieve. I personally like to play it by ear but use theory to understand what I'm actually doing. And obviously, I like my effects! IH




KlaatuBrute:
Just wanted to say I love you guys. Saw you play with Wilsen in Chicago last spring. I'm severely disappointed I couldn't score decent tix to your shows this weekend. Keep being awesome.
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	Thank you! aaaah Wilsen are so wonderful aren't they! I hope we can see you in Chicago sometime soon! E x




rumpel7:
Could you describe the moment or phase when you noticed that doing music would be a decent way to earn a living? Was there a "lets just try and see" moment?

Saw you in Cologne some months ago, still stunned :)
	>	weareDaughter:
	>	I tried and saw by moving to London. That's how I met Elena and then Remi. IH




Krepo:
No question here, just want to add that I really like listening to some of your music when i'm relaxing after a busy day. Keep up the good work.



ynevdm:
Remi, do you remember Jihea? We met her a couple of months ago... She's playing with EG now. Somehow everything leads back to OH.. ;)
	>	weareDaughter:

Charlieblu:
Hi guys , I love the drums sounds in your album ! Where did you record them ? Thanks . 
	>	weareDaughter:

lhdlovebooh:
I've seen you during your performance in Paris last year. If I remember well, it's almost the birthday of Rémi, so Joyeux anniversaire.

Dane91:
Hi guys, thanks for the AMA! 

I just wanted to say that Smother is possibly the most upsetting song I've ever heard (in a good way); I like to just sit there listening to it and reflect on certain what ifs. Something about it just hits me really deep and I can't really explain it, but it makes me happy and sad at the same time - it's euphoric. 

My question is: have you ever gotten too emotionally compromised when singing it live?

Thank you!

frostmage:
I like your version of "Get Lucky" more than the original version. I've heard some people say they didn't like your version, which makes me really sad. In my opinion, you gave a whole different meaning to the song. A sad but a more beautiful one. When you were covering the song, did you realize this?



s4v8:
Hi!

Heard Medicine on CBS's Person of Interest last night and was immediately drawn to the song.  Keep up the great work!



austinromeo:
Hey guys! I saw you guys in Switzerland this past November and you guys were absolutely incredible. What really struck me during the concert was the way the audience responded to your music. I have never seen an audience so still, yet so entranced and captivated with a performance. What is your take on the audience’s response to your music/performance? 

PS After the show in Fribourg, it was so nice to talk to you guys for a bit! It was freezing out and you stuck around to chat with us, the trio from the US -- definitely the highlight of the trip. Xx



na5154:
What are you guys' favourite Radiohead song? I know you all take inspiration from them. Love your work by the way. One of my favourite bands x

_Azirov:
You guys are absolutely brilliant. I have everything from the Demos EP to "if you leave." I can't wait until you come to New York.  I'm curious about your songwriting process.. Do you write lyrics first, or the instrumental? Also, who would be the band's top 3 musical influences?



[deleted]:	MassDonRap
I have managed to persuade about 20 people to come to your Somerset House gig this summer by showing them photos of the venue and playing them "Landfill". Please, please, please, please, please can you play it? One of the most stunning vocal performances that I have ever heard.



Osama_Bin_Diesel:
Hey y'all. I saw you play last year in Philly and you were amazing. Elena your voice is so hauntingly beautiful. You're my favorite artist. 

What or who are your inspirations for your work?

What songs and artists are on your playlist right now?

I love you guys. Stay up



Beckyboo1123:
Heya, you're music is so special and beautiful it reflects something out of this world! In saying this do you guys have an religious or spiritual faith that inspires your music or your lives? Thanks! xx



MaceoPlex:
Hey guys! Saw you supporting Sigur Ros at Jodrell Bank, was a fantastic experience all round. Elena: do you always look so nervous on stage? Or was my presence having a direct impact on you?



gerryt32:
If you could choose any artist to tour with currently (other than The National of course!), who would it be?  

Also, what are your favourite/least favourite aspects of touring?

Hi :)
Love your music so much! I was wondering who wrote the lyrics for 'Smother' and does the person the song is about know that the song was written about them?
