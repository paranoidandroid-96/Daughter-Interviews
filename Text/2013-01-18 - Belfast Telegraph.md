# Daughter comes of age
## Ahead of a Belfast gig, Remi Aguilella from the hip new folk band tells Edwin Gilson about finding their way in the music industry and coping with their growing popularity

Remi Aguilella, of hotlytipped London folk band Daughter, has a case of interview jitters. “I’m shaking on this end of the phone,” he stutters. “I’m a really nervous guy.”

The French-born drummer would appear to have little to be apprehensive about currently, though; Daughter (consisting also of singer/songwriter Elena Tonra and guitarist Igor Haefeli) are rapidly becoming a pretty big deal. They’re about to embark on a sold out UK tour and have just finished recording their debut album, entitled If You Leave, at Abbey Road no less. For Aguilella, this meant fulfilling a boyhood dream — not making a record, but having a chance to snoop around the world-famous studios.

“I grew up a massive Beatles fan so when we went there I became a tourist,” he laughs. “I took loads of pictures that I probably wasn’t allowed to take.” 

After performing solo with just an acoustic guitar for a spell, Tonra started the band while at music school in London. It was here she met Haefeli, now her boyfriend, and Aguilella. The latter was made up at being invited to be a part of Daughter. 

“I got a message from Elena one day asking me to join,” says the 23-year-old. “It was thequickest decision of my life. I’d heard some of her stu� before and really, really loved it.”

The ‘stuff’ in question is moody, ambient and stripped- back. Tonra’s lyrics are full of tales of pain and the contradictions of love: “I want you so much/but I hate your guts” from their song Landfill and “All our feelings are dead” from Youth are prime examples. Aguilella says Daughter’s enigmatic frontwoman reveals nothing of the meaning of her poetry to the rest of the band — but he wouldn’t have it any other way.

“Elena really does isolate herself within the lyrics; I’ve never asked her about them because they are clearly so personal. They’re so powerful that in a way I’d rather imagine the meaning than have it directly told to me.”

When quizzed on how Daughter got their break in such a competitive landscape, the drummer becomes a little flustered: “I’ve no idea really, we’ve been extremely lucky I guess. We’re very appreciative of the help we’ve had.”

The band has no doubt benefitted from having followers in high places, including Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens, not that Daughter’s growing fanbase will care. Their Facebook ‘Like’ count stands at nearly 16,000. Not bad for a group that hasn’t released an album yet.

“We have great fans everywhere; recently we were in Denmark and loads of people came out to see us at 1am, it was nuts,” says Aguilella. “The crowds we play to are always so quiet and respectful of our music that it’s frightening at times, especially as we usually like to play in obscure places like churches.”

The band’s next gig at the Black Box in Belfast on January 27 as part of the Out to Lunch festival won’t quite be in church-like surroundings, though. Nevertheless, despite Aguilella’s assessment that the band are still “pretty much amateurs on the live circuit”, it sounds as though it’ll be a heartfelt performance. “We just want to give everything we have,” he says. “I’m sure the atmosphere will be magical.”

**Three of a kind: Daughter**

It’ll be a homecoming gig for him too — well, sort of. “Some people think I’m Irish because of my accent. I lived in America for a while so maybe it comes from that. All I can say is that I’m not Irish, unfortunately.”

It’s the fate of every new folk band to be bracketed in with the so-called ‘London folk revolution’ that took place half a decade ago. Bands like Mumford and Sons and Noah and the Whale, along with Laura Marling, certainly helped bring folk back into the hearts and minds of young music fans. In many ways the craze is still in full flow, judging by the current popularity of previous Going Out cover stars like Lucy Rose and Jake Bugg. Aguilella thinks new listeners should acknowledge the old greats of the genre too.

“I hope younger people will hear those contemporary bands and then go back and listen to the classic stuff — Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, artists like that,” he says. “Bands like Mumford and Sons in�uenced us a little when making the album, but then we started to build our own sound. It took a while, but hopefully people will enjoy the results.”

There’s just one more potentially prickly issue to cover. Daughter’s song Home was featured on US television drama Grey’s Anatomy, a programme it’s safe to say is not exactly home to all things cutting-edge. Indie flops The Fray are among many bands to see theiralready �agging credibility su�er a further blow by inclusion on the show’s soundtrack. Is Aguilella not concerned about this?

“We don’t want people saying we’re sell-outs, obviously,” he ponders. “But if being on TV means more people will hear our music I’m all for it.” As nervy as the drummer is — or claims to be — he and his band can look back on 2012 with great pride as the year Daughter ‘ broke’. Now, what for 2013?

“I can’t believe this is all happening, really,” says Remi. “Last year was amazing so let’s
hope it carries on in the same vein!”
