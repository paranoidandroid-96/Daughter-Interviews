## From Letterman to debut album; Daughter have had quite the year.

I remember watching massive bands on it, those big Letterman moments, and then suddenly we're asked to play there: Incredible."

The Daughter that sit across from us in the basement of an east London bar are not the same Daughter we met with a year ago. Singer-songwriter Elena Tonra, guitarist-producer Igor Haefeli and drummer Remi Aguilella have had a whirlwind year - which, yes, included appearing on one of America's most famous TV programmes.

Since the last time we saw them, they ve signed with indie behemoth 4AD, who Elena assures us have been "absolutely amazing, they've given us so much space to just do our own thing and make the record we want to make."They released their first single with the label, 'Smother' in October 2012. They've toured both across Europe and the US including support slots with Beirut and various festival appearances. They had to give up their jobs. 

"Well, I kind of got told I'd have to quit," explains Elena, "they didn't fire me, but it was quite close. There was an opportunity to go on tour, and I was like 'oh yeah, can I have another week off?' and they said no."

"It was fine," she says, giggling. "I was living with my parents at the time so I could just raid their fridge for a few months! I think they were quite happy to get rid of us..."

The trio's debut album, 'If You Leave', was recorded "all over London" throughout 2012, juggling between various commitments and when spaces were available - and cheap. 

"We were on a tight budget. So we did some here, some there, wherever was cheapest," Igor laughs. The cheapest of all, then, would be his and Elena's flat, which we're assured does feature in the final recordings. "All the like, really noisy bits that are really badly recorded, they'll be our flat," says Elena.

Bar a few of the songs - 'Youth' taken from 'The Wild Youth', and "two other songs that are older, though that were never really released, they were always demos" - it's all new material. And, with writing between tours, and for a while at least, jobs, Elena found new ways to work.

"There's one track that started off as this weird ambient loop that Igor made," she begins, "I think we were just playing around on the computer one day and he made this sound which was really strange and I was like 'wow, that's great, I'm gonna write to it'. I don't even know if it's actually still in the song, it might be there in a lesser form, but it was just strange to write that way round."

A year ensued of dipping in and out of recording. "Even when we were on tour we had the album in our minds," Igor considers, "It was this thing that was growing, getting more and more intense."

And they're the first to admit they were difficult to work with. "We're very much perfectionists," adds Elena, "I do remember one case where we got really bad. Me and Igor had stayed in this studio for hours, we had a lockout so we were there from 10 in the morning on the first day, until 10 in the morning the next, and we wanted to stay longer [laughs]. This guy was like 'Go home! Please go home!' I think when we're in something, it can probably be quite destructive for people who lead actually sociable lives."

"There were times when I was sleeping under the mixing desk," Igor grins. 

"We definitely could have kept going for a long time", continues Elena, before trailing off. "Arrangements-wise, the people that we were working with had their limits of time, Ken and Jolyon [Thomas] only had that space of time in which they could work with us for the record. So there was that deadline, but I think it was a blessing because I think we probably would have..."

"...We did push it until literally the last moment," Igor picks up, "we got it mastered at Abbey Road just before Christmas, and it was literally the last day there was a mastering engineer!"

They've got to be relieved it's done, right? Right? 

"It's a tough one," Elena debates with herself, "Personally I am relieved that we've finished and it is over with, but I think until it's actually out I will be 'OK I'm letting you go', because I can't really listen to it still. I think we've been with it, been really in to it for such a long time that it's hard to do it. I was like that with 'The Wild Youth', I couldn't listen to that for a very long time after we recorded it, I was just like 'get it away from me!"

*Daughter's debut album 'If You Leave' will be released on 18th March via 4AD.*
