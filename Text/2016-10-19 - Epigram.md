# An Interview with Daughter

**Elena Tonra, the celestial voice and face of indie-folk trio Daughter, took time out of rehearsing for their blockbuster gig next week at Bristol’s Colston Hall to chat about their new album *Not to Disappear* with *Epigram*‘s Deputy Music Editor Ellen Kemp.**

Elena Tonra is lovely. She doesn’t say hello, she sings it. Her speech is speckled with laughter and she chats in the friendliest manner imaginable.

Daughter are currently rehearsing for their upcoming tour, I ask her how it’s going and her reply is buzzing: she mentions “big old production-rehearsal vibes,” and describes how the band have been investing in sound, atmosphere and lights: “I think we are quite weird about that, we want to make it look and sound as good as it possibly can.”

The latest release, *Not to Disappear* is a testament to this: a record with a brilliant refinement crafted whilst touring their debut. “With every tour there are things where we learn something new and bring it to the next tour and probably to writing the next record.” She laughs, “Hopefully we’ll make a next record! That’d be nice!”

It’s likely they will, with their success so far. Daughter are scheduled to play some of their biggest shows yet, including the notorious Brixton Academy (and our very own Colston Hall). A daunting proposal perhaps: “The more shows I feel like we’re playing the more nervous I am about playing shows! I feel like it should be the reverse”

She mentions feeling a sense of dread for bigger shows, but adds that it’s not something she lets affect the performance “For me it’s mainly just a fear thing rather than the quality of the show or the connection with an audience. I think actually we have the same connection whether we are in a small room or a big room.”

This is easy to understand: Daughter’s music has a sure-footed focus on the emotional drive of their songs, something difficult for many musicians to embrace on stage. I ask her if this is the case: “I like to feel that as soon as the song is written, there’s a sense of personal understanding. A kind of release of whatever that particular feeling was that was obviously stored up in my head before I wrote the song. And actually, once it’s written it almost feels as if I’ve somehow been able to extract it from within me and make it more of an abstract thing.”

She continues, “Most of the time, I feel I’m quite emotionally strong about it. Even though there are some songs where the subject matter is terribly sad and I think if I had a conversation with people about it I would probably get quite upset,  I feel that when it’s within a song and when we are playing it live it doesn’t feel… like I’m on the verge of breaking down!” she laughs “I generally feel like when we play it’s a positive thing, enjoying playing music and getting into your own trance-like state while you’re with your friends on stage.”

The lyrical style on the new album is quite different to their debut: If You Leave is poetic and vulnerable, whereas Not to Disappear has more of a frankness to its lyrics. “It wasn’t a conscious decision in terms of “I’m gonna write in a more direct way” or anything” she muses.

“When I started writing songs for the second album, I was quite… freaked out, maybe? Just about the fact that stuff wasn’t coming out of my head in the same way that it had done for the first record or for the three EPs. I was almost like “I can’t write anymore! I don’t know why! I don’t know why things aren’t just like *coming out in poems!*” she adds a slightly giggling intonation.  “No, they are just conversations and they are direct statements rather than hiding or shadowing things in nature or metaphor.”

She explains a little more, “I basically didn’t edit anything out. I just thought “If I’m writing this stuff down, I mean it and I feel it, and this is truthful and it’s the place I’m in and if it’s uncomfortable to listen to then maybe, actually, that is weirdly a positive thing.”

```
“My head would explode if I had to keep all this stuff in and be the perfect robot lady that doesn’t have any emotions because ‘showing emotions is weak’…I don’t think it makes me a stronger woman to pretend to be fine, I think actually I should talk about how sometimes my brain melts and I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing!

```

“With ‘No Care’ there are some lines which don’t paint me in a particularly great light. I talk about sex in a really kind of…  dark way. It’s not a pleasant way of talking about sex,” she reflects. “It was a song where I was like, “well, I could just not say that but then why should I edit that out because it’s uncomfortable to listen to, if at that moment in time I felt like that?”

Tonra goes on to say that the directness of the record could be to do with her personality “I think, for many reasons I probably haven’t spoken about things before. But then there’s a way of translating them into what I’m doing that’s kind of getting those strange truths across.”  She mentions how recently conversations with friends have become geared towards new topics: “We’re having conversations about stuff that we just wouldn’t as teenagers…now it’s kind of ‘Nah, fuck that, I’m gonna talk about all manner of things.’”

The first single from *Not To Disappear*, ‘Doing The Right Thing,’ speaks through the eyes of an alzheimer’s patient, and is based on Tonra’s own family experience. The heart-wrenching openness of this song is astounding for such an uncomfortable subject.

I ask her whether this particular honesty is something she feel we should see more of in songwriting.“I don’t feel comfortable writing things that aren’t truthful from my own perspective,” she ponders this a little “At the moment I’m feeling really strange about the behaviours of people. Even in terms of social media, this constant trying to be the perfect version of something,” she grabs hold of this thought. “The iPhone updating again to be the best version of itself… everything has to be the most functional, speediest, kind of thing and I just don’t get it.”

“My head would explode if I had to keep all this stuff in and be the perfect robot lady that doesn’t have any emotions because ‘showing emotions is weak’” she says, “I don’t think it makes me a stronger woman to pretend to be fine, I think actually I should talk about how sometimes my brain melts and I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing!”

For my final question I ask how she separates herself from her intense musical world.

“Actually me and Igor were talking about this yesterday; sometimes we get so consumed by what we are doing in writing and making music and it is kind of our life – like this is what we enjoy doing but it also just takes over and becomes this storm, this tornado-whirlwind”

“I’ve just been trying as much as possible to see friends and reconnect with people” she says, adding “…and do some yoga, and read some more strange sort of books about psychopaths, and just try and do things I like doing,” she explains this: “Things to try and order myself and make things more real. Because I feel like I’ve been living a very surreal life for the past five years, six years, whatever it is!”

As I bid goodbye to the delightful Elena Tonra I fleetingly mention the Bristol show – she’s bursting with enthusiasm: “It’s gonna be good!” she trills “We’ve got some hopefully exciting plans for Bristol as well!”
