## Introduction

**London indie trio Daughter sound like a band reinvigorated on their second album, Not To Disappear.**

The masked themes and obscuring layers of reverb of their 4AD debut, If You Leave, now sound almost muddied in comparison to this focussed and powerfully direct version of the band.

Not To Disappear has been forged after two years of a heavy touring schedule, establishing a more self-assured tone 

Whereas that first album saw guitarist Igor Haefeli and drummer Remi Aguilella build a record of swirling reverbs around frontwoman Elena Tonra’s pensive bedroom-penned ballads, Not To Disappear has been forged after two years of a heavy touring schedule, establishing a more self-assured tone.

“We felt ready,” Igor tells MusicRadar. “But [before that] we all needed a bit of time away from each other for a while, to live, and to get the creative juices flowing again.”

Having also co-produced the album with Nicolas Vernhes (Deerhunter, Wye Oak, The War On Drugs) in New York, the guitarist is in a good position to judge. Here, Igor reflects on the record’s inception and imagery, valuable production lessons and how the band themselves learned not to disappear…

## One step beyond

**This album is a bold step away from If You Leave. Daughter, as a band, were not previously famed for their confidence. Where’s that come from?**

“I think it was just growing up a bit. There was a will to hide behind a bit less reverb and for Elena to write in a more direct way. We also wanted to tighten things up a bit. It’s hard to explain, but in terms of dynamics, on the first record, we let ourselves be surprised a bit more in the studio.

It was very much the intention to be more confident, just because that’s what the songs were suggesting 

“The way we recorded was a bit like a jigsaw, so it was pieced together in a nice way, but – dynamically speaking – maybe sometimes there was a sense that it [accidentally] became louder than intended.”

**Now Elena’s being more direct, lyrically, it feels that the playing is reflecting that…**

“Yeah! [Last time] a lot of that was Elena saying ‘Turn the music up on my vocals’ constantly and I was going heavy with the reverb on the guitar. This time it was very much the intention to be more confident, just because that’s what the songs were suggesting.

“If You Leave was a bit more eery and from a dream, whereas this one we wanted to anchor in things that were around us. There’s a lot of city imagery. A song like New Edge really informed the rest of the record, because a lot of the images we were getting in our minds were of hot concrete and the sun and LA highways and that sort of thing.”

## An urban dweller

**So hot concrete, LA highways… How do the images on this album differ to the images that you associated with If You Leave?**

“I think the difference is that If You Leave was more of a landscape. I became more involved in my mind, visually speaking, with this idea of big valleys and all that kind of thing, whereas this one is more urban. Even from just living in Dalston in London, as well, in summer it gets all kinds of weird! That’s just how I personally relate to it.

“Even a song like Alone With You, I see that as a sort of lament of modern city life, but obviously in quite an intimate sort of way, but for Elena it’s her own story.”

**Right, so that idea that we live in a closer proximity to each other than ever, but…**

“But we’re still very lonely and very alienated, even, from our jobs and each other.”

**You’re an atmospheric, effects-focussed player. Do you think you’ve been able to include more of yourself on this record?**

“I don’t know. I try not to think about it as having ‘my thing’ come across, because I also produced the record and I have to be really mindful of that. But at the same time, because I’m producing the record, a lot more of my sensibility comes across, in a way. From a guitar point of view, I just tried to get the best sound I could, but it was very much about the sound needing to fit the mix, rather than needing to be mixed in.”

## Beating the beats

**You’ve also incorporated more samples and electronic beats on Not To Disappear. A lot of indie musicians do that very badly. How did you avoid that?**

“It was definitely something that I was very mindful of. I love electronic music, but I do agree that a lot of the time when the genres blend together that it becomes quite tacky quite quickly.

“That’s where Nicolas Vernhes, who co-produced the record, was really good, because he has a lot more experience producing records and seeing certain things being used, so he was very helpful in avoiding some of the obvious pitfalls.”

Do you recall any particular advice that Nicolas Vernhes gave you to help you achieve that?

“I think one thing that he said a few times that I really related to was that just from the get-go, from the first two seconds of a song, people need to know it’s that song. You have that trademark to a song. That then raises the other point: that it needs to be a trademark, but not a charicature of yourself. We were very cautious to not fall into that trap on the sophomore album of feeling like it’s safe to just do the same thing you did the first time around.”
