DAUGHTER’s brilliantly brooding and atmospheric music is mesmerising to listen to on record but the band’s beefed up and intense live show proves that they’re the real deal.

The London-based band is made up of singer/songwriter/guitarist Elena Tonra, Igor Haefeli (guitars/effects/production) and drummer Remi Aguilella – plus touring member and multi-instrumentalist Lucy.

As they get set to release their new album Not To Disappear next Friday and begin a huge tour that starts in England and Scotland and then takes them across Europe and North America, Tonra says she’s happy that the live show has gone across well.

“I’m really glad you said that, because we spend a lot of time working on it. Igor is very 'on it’ in terms of live stuff,” she says. “He has a great production brain and he also wants to make sure that we can play things live. We like to have all the parts ready. Even if they’re electronic sounds, they can be triggered by humans and so we don’t have to rely on technology. Igor works really really hard on that.”

Daughter put on a storming show in Belfast in January 2013 and Tonra hopes to get to play some Irish dates this year again.

“Hopefully we can get over, yeah. I always like going to Ireland and we always have a lot of fun. And I have Irish family too, so it always feels a bit like going home. My grandparents on my dad’s side are from Co Mayo and we have family in Dublin, so I was over quite a bit when I was a kid.”

Daughter played a handful of British gigs late last year to debut material from the new album and also played in Japan and Singapore. The album itself was recorded and mixed in New York with producer Nicolas Vernhes (Animal Collective, The War on Drugs, Deerhunter).

“We wrote everything in London and did lots of demos,” says Tonra. “But we got to a stage where we exhausted ourselves out. Igor was producing it and we all thought it would be nice to have a new set of ears involved.

“So we went to New York to work with Nicolas in his studio. He’s a great person and it was really beneficial. Someone from our label, 4AD, told us that they thought he’d be a good fit for us, so we had a Skype meeting with Nicolas and we sent him our demos and he really liked them. It was great.”

The new album is a sonic step up from the band’s excellent 2013 debut If You Leave, with No Care, Numbers and the utterly epic Fossa just a few of the standouts.

Yet the addition of so many electronic parts/effects/drums posed a few problems when Tonra and her bandmates started to rehearse the songs to play live.

“There were definitely a couple of songs where we were like, 'HOW are we going to play these?’ Remi was like, 'I don’t know what I can do with No Care, because there are seven drum parts going at the same time’. But we have a fourth musician for this tour, Lucy. She plays bass, guitar and keys.”

One of the most important songs on the album for Tonra is Doing The Right Thing, which tackles her grandmother’s struggle with Alzheimer’s and features the lyric 'not to disappear’.

The band asked film-makers Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (directors of the Nick Cave film 20,000 Days on Earth) to create three films for Not To Disappear, based on stories written by author Stuart Evers.

“It was great, although I wasn’t very helpful. Everyone else was stressed out trying to film three videos in three days and I was just drinking tea, thinking 'This looks beautiful’,” laughs Tonra.

“Iain and Jane made our first ever music video, so it was really nice to work with them again. Me and Igor and Remi don’t love being in our videos, so it’s nice to just be in them subliminally."

She’s looking forward to their first gig of the year in Cambridge next Friday, the day the album is released.

"It’s also my birthday that day, which is exciting. Lots of drinks,” she laughs. “But I don’t really drink before shows.”

She recalls having a couple of bevs after Daughter’s Black Box gig in Belfast three years ago.

“I feel like I drank a really weird drink that last time I was in Belfast. Somebody was like, 'Try this’. I can’t remember what it was called.”

Was it Buckfast, by any chance?

“Hmm, that does sound familiar...”

Not To Disappear is released on 4AD on January 15. For tour updates, see ohdaughter.com
