When the two songwriters in UK trio Daughter ended their romantic relationship after the release of debut album If You Leave in 2013, they didn’t expect to return with such a strong second album.

But if the two years touring the world after the break-up sounds like a less-than-ideal situation, singer Elena Tonra says it was just the tonic for getting back on track as friends with former beau, guitarist Igor Haefeli.

“It tested things for the band,” Tonra says from Tokyo, on a four-day break from touring, where they are “drinking all the sake” and happily hanging out again.

“I think it was good because a lot of the break-up stuff was sorted out in two years on the road.

“When we were together and on the road it was a positive thing, it was an adventure. And then when we weren’t it was a strange time because we broke up not long after If You Leave came out and spent two years with each other every day.

“Touring for two years was us getting over it and (new album Not to Disappear) was ‘We can actually write together — because we’re friends’,” she continues.

“There’s a reason we enjoy writing together, because our brains are connected and we feel like creatively we really match each other.

“Just maybe not romantically,” Tonra laughs.

The singer is quick to point out Not to Disappear isn’t a break-up album, preferring to see If You Leave as the “pre-break up record”.

Disappear touches on it but deals mainly in themes of alienation and loneliness. In retrospect, it’s all quite revealing.

“The first album I look back on and think it’s literally an in-depth study of how your relationship is ending,” the 25-year-old says.

“It wasn’t until I was looking back over (Not to Disappear) that I thought all the songs are about loneliness ... it was obviously a state of mind I was in. Some of the imagery’s a bit gross, which I think is kind of good.

“Slimey lyrics,” Tonra laughs. “To write stuff that even you feel a little cringed out by I think is a positive.”

Not to Disappear is out now.
