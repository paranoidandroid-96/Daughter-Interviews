LAST TIME DAUGHTER WAS IN MINNEAPOLIS, THEY PLAYED AT 7TH STREET ENTRY, A TINY SIDE ATTACHMENT TO THE FAMOUS FIRST AVENUE. THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS INTIMATE AND GENUINE, FILLED WITH SHY SMILES FROM VOCALIST ELENA TONRA AND A WARM LISTENING COLLECTIVE HEART SHARED BY THE AUDIENCE. AFTERWARD, THEY STOPPED TO GET PIZZA, BARELY RECOGNIZED, AND A MAN YELLED OUT, “GUY WITH THE ACCENT AND THE CHICK!” THEY BRIEFLY CONSIDERED IT AS A BAND NAME.

This time around, Daughter sold out First Avenue, generating a line of passionate fans braving the brisk Minneapolis elements—one that
stretches around the corner hours before the doors even open. The packed venue glistens with teary-eyed fans singing their broken hearts out while guitarist Igor Haefeli can’t help but smile as the crowd's
emotions spill onto the stage. The brilliant performance features songs from The Wild Youth EP, /f You Leave, and their most recent album, Not to Disappear. Between numbers, Elena can barely get a word out as the fans cheer relentlessly, so she simply lets out a shy smile and laugh while looking down and shaking her head as drummer Remi Aguilella raises his glass to the crowd—perhaps a toast to not disappearing.

“The reaction is more than we ever expected,” Remi says humbly. The contrast in fan reception is huge from last time, yet the performance is quite reminiscent of that show at the 7th Street Entry. Elena’s stunning vocals softly carry through the still room as Igor creates acomplimentary soundscape and Remi keeps it in time—just like before. Everything and everyone on stage seems to hold the same personality, but Daughter had to have had a master plan in order to get to where they are today.

“We don't really have a plan,” Elena laughs. “The bands that we love we have always explored. I think Radiohead is a big influence. I love the idea that you can explore different avenues.” She shares that In Rainbows is her favorite Radiohead album while Igor proclaims that his is Hail the to Thief.

“We wanted to evolve, but we trusted our sensibilities,” Igor explains. “We obviously have natural inclinations toward sounds and the things that we do. Despite the fact that we were experimenting, we got together in a way that was very Daughter. We are still part of these songs.”

These natural musical inclinations tend to be the perfect compliment to Elena’s vocals and lyrics. Whether the music is emphasizing the feelings within the songs or directly contrasting them, Daughter's message surfaces powerfully. “[The music] is quite instinctive,” Igor responds when asked about how he and Remi create Daughter's sound. “It’s not necessarily very thought out. We either play with the lyrics or we play in another direction. Sometimes the sound is soft and slow to pair with the lyrics, but then it will contrast and become quite expansive. The rhythm is instinctive, but it still often fits with the feeling behind the songs.

“Sometimes it changes the way you feel the song,” Elena adds in reference to “To Belong,” which features uplifting music and sad lyrics. Igor expands, “I think, as a listener, it can be quite comforting when the music enhances that feeling and offers release from the harrowing lyrics.”

The unique musical feel behind Not to Disappear did not form overnight. After spending so much time together as a band, Remi explains, “You feel like you can predict what the other person is going for. You have a sense of what the other person is trying to do-chemistry, in a way. We've done so many shows together that, even when we do sound checks, we collaborate on each other's energy.”

Igor illuminates on this thought. “We gave ourselves the time to experiment. I think it is a more cohesive record than the first one.” Specifically citing a well-calculated jam session that occurred while recording their new song, “Fossa,” Igor continues, “The outro section was something that wasn’t there originally, and what happened was Remy kept on playing drums, because they were the foundation. When it came to me playing guitar, I kept playing over it. We found a pattern that we liked, and we ended up recording guitars and relaying vocals. It was a studio moment. It was one of those surprises that sometimes happen.”


While Daughter’s musical progression comes instinctively, they still strive to explore in order to create. Beyond their music, Elena explores her inner depths to form the lyrics with which their fans identify. She insists that all there is to say about her songs is on the page, aside from the occasional exception. “I’ve always thought, lyrically, that all I'll say in them I've already said,” Elena translates. “I guess that when you write, you include everything you feel, or the most that you are comfortable talking about.”

“In Not to Disappear, I think it’s quite clear what the songs are about,” Elena goes on, explaining how the new album took a bolder turn. “I think If You Leave was indirect, and this one was more [to the point].”

That wasn't the only transformation when it came to writing the album’s lyrics, however. Elena continues to explain how, this time around, she moved away from just being a victim — which is how she was often portrayed in If You Leave. Instead, she transitioned into writing with a more self-critical voice. “The first album was more of a relationship breakdown where I felt like the wronged person. This album is more comfortable in saying sometimes I'm an asshole as well. It’s about the failings of two people. Not that this album is about heartbreak—I don’t think it really is. But if it ever touches on that, I think it is quite honest.”

In the midst of her self-exploration, Elena never channels her happy self while absorbed in the writing process, and it’s pretty evident in Daughter's music. “In the songs that seem the most depressing, I have to be there to write them,” Elena expounds. “I become the most inspired when I’m not feeling OK. I never seem to write anything happy. Even if we are just cool and jamming, I'm still singing like, ‘Dying!!!’ I think it is just the way my brain is wired. We have made [unreleased] humorous or at least emotionally neutral recordings. Like, life's alright.”

Although Elena’s lyrics are painful and sad, creating them is more so as an act of therapy rather than an experience of revisiting that pain. “I think when I go a long period where I don’t write, I find it’s a really stressful time,” Elena reveals. “I go mad. I feel like if we don't feed the creative bug, then we go a bit loopy. I think it is an illness and a therapy.”

Luckily —or not— even in the midst of touring, Elena still finds that sadness and the inspiration to write. “There are sad and happy aspects to touring,” Elena analyzes. “There are eleven or twelve of us in our gang, and we are seeing the world. But when you get back home and try to readjust to not being away, it’s like, ‘Hello, alien beings that we don’t know anymore.”

Igor magnifies this point, adding, “You miss people evolving through that month. Getting used to them again means relearning and re-educating yourself on those people.”

Great art tends to be a side effect even when the members of Daughter aren't completely immersed in music through touring, writing, or recording. Not long ago, the band decided to release videos for “Doing the Right Thing,” “Numbers,” and “How.” Although the songs themselves are not serial, the music videos all go together as one interconnected piece of art. “We worked with Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, who did the “Still” music video. We were thinking about videos quite early,” Elena discloses. “We were lucky that they made that beautiful video for us. We had a rough idea of the singles that we wanted to put out. We sent them the music and lyrics, and they sent them to their friend, Stuart Evers, who is a short story writer. They made the stories into screenplays and finally short films. It's kind of amazing how they made these three videos in three or four days. We didn't have much of a budget but they made it work. Even the actors were incredible.”

“They are beautiful pieces of art,” Remi explicates. “It was all shot at the same time with the same people. They really kept it all together and you can see it as three short movies that are all one thing rather than three separate music videos that are just used as promotional material.”

Ultimately, outside of music, there isn’t much that captures the interest of Daughter. “I like researching about psychopaths,” Elena admits. “I like watching things that are crime-related. I find humans interesting. Studying humans is my jam, but music is my outlet. I get frustrated, because I’m not very good at other things. Not that I'm great at music,” she muses.

As for the other two, Remi enjoys photography and woodworking, while Igor insists that he’s not really interested in much else. “I don't really have anything I like,” Igor laughs. “I suppose I like spending time with people I love, but music consumes my life. I read about it all the time.”

With this in mind, investigating how Daughter caught on so fast is simple: they explore different facets of themselves in order to pursue what is most important to them. Elena explores herself for the powerful lyrics that provide the backbone for Daughter. Meanwhile, Igor and Remi explore their instincts to bring the songs alive with an incredibly creative sound, enhancing the feeling that comes with the music. Still, perhaps most importantly, the trio that is Daughter is just being themselves, and that evidently resonates with their fans.
