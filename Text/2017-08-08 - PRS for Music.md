Before the Storm is the prequel to Life is Strange, the BAFTA Award-winning videogame which drew on real life issues and characters for its narrative. The 2015 original featured music from the likes of Mogwai, Foals, Breton, Sparklehorse and alt-J.

Daughter’s Elena Tonra said: ‘We are so proud to have written the soundtrack for *Life Is Strange: Before The Storm*. It was our first experience working on an original soundtrack, and we are so honoured to have been given the opportunity to work with the team.

‘We loved the story on first read as it centres around realistic female lead characters who are emotional, intelligent, sensitive and badass in equal measure. I think the characters themselves have really inspired the soundscapes we have created. It was a pleasure to be involved.’
