# INTERVIEW: Daughter “I don’t want it to become a routine”

Posted on March 8, 2013 by ELLE P	Leave a comment

Daughter is doing well. After several well-received EPs, a world tour and a record deal with 4AD, the British indie folk band now unveils her debut “If You Leave”. We talked with the trio in Brussels with a Blonde Leffe by our side and a long questionnaire in our heads.

Daughter (c) Janne Degryse

**How would you describe Daughter to people who aren’t familiar with your music?**

**Remi Aguilella:** We’re a multicultural band. But it might be hard to describe what the style of music is, you know.

**Igor Haefeli:** I think it’s a mixture of our influences, because they’re quite diverse. Elena brings the really strong song-writing, the lyrics and the themes of the songs. Remi has this sort of jazz, classical background. And then I come from a production point of view, interested in sounds. I like to bring some effects to the atmosphere too, some sort of ambience.

**Where does the name of your band come from?**

**Elena Tonra:** It’s not like the most interesting story of all, I guess. I just thought of it one day. Because, you know, I am one, and it relates pretty well to the music. It has this fragile thing about it. I basically didn’t want to use my own name. And having a name with just one word allows for a lot of different people to take a lot of different things out of it. It seemed like the right choice, ‘cause it’s not just my project.

**Back when you started out, you performed as a stripped-down acoustic singer-songwriter. Why did you decide to work with other musicians?**

**Elena:** I didn’t really enjoy doing the solo thing (laughs). I’m not the most natural or comfortable performer in the world. It was definitely a very terrifying experience most of the time. And I also felt quite limited in my own abilities, limited in the sound, in what I could create by myself. It wasn’t sufficient enough for me. I really just wanted someone to come op with different things. So that’s why I kinda started out working with Igor, quite early on. First there were just two guitars, and we ended up having a lot of demo’s, you know, coming up with random shit, ‘cause it was fun and it was really nice to work with somebody eIse. Igor was completely different from me in how he approaches songwriting. He’s more about production and electronic elements. Whereas I’m the more like classic writing, you know, girl with a guitar. And obviously now it’s just really nice to go up on stage with all of us.

**You had quite a busy schedule last year, playing shows all over the world and recording new songs for your debut album. How did you experience all of that?**

**Elena:** It was difficult, you know, to get the album the way we wanted it, while having this kind of split focus between touring and writing the album. But it was obviously amazing to go to different countries and play, and just do a lot of festivals. It was something that we really enjoyed. It’s not that we were like: oh no, we’ve gotta go to America now. (laughs) But at the same time we still had this kind of goal, just to make something we really really love. To make something that we’re proud of. And it was hard work to find that time and to find that space. ‘Cause I’m not the kind of person that can sit in a rehearsal studio and make a song. That’s not how it happens. I need a lot of solitude and a lot of thinking space. And that was difficult. But I’m really proud of us though, that we managed to finish it last year. Especially for me, the album is like a document of last year. It started in January and it finished in December.

**Did you expect all of that?**

**Igor:** No. We definitely wanted to make music, and put something out there. So we had a first and a second ep. But it wasn’t an absolute goal. Someone asked us today: how do you like playing the big stages, and are you ambitious? Well you know, I think that we’re ambitious in the sense that we want to play music that we like. And that’s the type of ambition we have. It’s definitely not measured by the success we have, or the size of the stages. But obviously it’s great to know that more and more people can relate to our music.

**Now about your upcoming album. Are you excited about the release?**

**Elena:** Yes, we are excited, obviously! But it’s always kind of scary, releasing something  into the unknown. ‘Cause we’ve been around it for so long. We do kind of think of it as a child, you know. (laughs) But irregardless of whether people are rude about our child, we’re just very excited to be able to play new stuff and to experiment with our live show. Especially now with the different elements that are involved in the album. The kind of more electronic side. So we still got to figure it out how we can do it live.

**Did the album turn out the way you wanted it to?**

**Igor:** Yeah, sort of.  We’re quite perfectionist, you know, so there are quite a few things that we maybe could have done better. And that’s why hopefully we will be able to make a second record. There also was an element of unknown, of course. I think it was probably the first time that we didn’t feel completely in control of everything, ‘cause there’s always shambles and there’s chaos as well. But that makes it a bit more new, wild and interesting, I guess. But there’s a strong identity to it as a whole, which is very important to me, producing it.

**The artwork is rather mysterious. What does it stand for and where did you get the idea?**

**Elena:** It’s sort of open to any kind of interpretation, really. It’s an image that can be taken in quite a beautiful way, or quite a kind of sinister way. But I’m down with whatever people think of it. I think it was very interesting to think of artwork in a different way. ‘Cause with the ep’s…

**Yeah, were those pictures of you?**

**Elena:** Yeah (laughs). They were just embarrassing pictures of me that I found in a box. It was interesting to have a chance to work on the artwork from a new perspective, and work with this amazing photographer called Eliot Lee Hazel. And we just saw his work, and he does have something mysterious about his pictures. And we had a lot of different photographs to compile so that we could make the album artwork as a whole. I think it’s a collection of material.

**Do you think there are many differences between your previous releases and your new album?**

**Elena:** Yeah, I guess. There’s something that is still our sound –oh I hate that word, oh my god a sound (laughs)- but I think that there is something that is kind of specific to us. But it’s a bit heavier than the stuff we’ve done before. It’s darker.

**Yeah, it’s pretty dark. Except for this one song, I guess Human is kinda… happier?**

**Elena:** Yeah, it’s our fastest song.

**Igor:** Yeah it’s definitely our most upbeat song. And I guess there is actually something positive, but then the lyrics are actually terribly dark. But I think in general we’re quite representative of the lyrics with the music as well.

**Your lyrics are very intriguing. Broken hearts and people leaving seem to be recurring themes. Are they based on anything in particular, looking at your life for instance?**

Elana: They’re definitely personal. Some are more about my life, and some based on emotions in general. But they all come from like, this place somewhere in my brain, or in my soul. So yeah.

**Do you have to be in this dark place to write them?**

**Elena:** Yeah. I don’t really sit down and say “oh I’ve got to write about this today”.  I think I have to wait for the song to almost come to me. That makes the process slightly slower, you know, to make a record and such, ‘cause I need to be honest, I can’t force myself. It has to be in a moment. So it has to come from a dark place, whether or not I have to be completely disparate when I do, it’s not really the case. But there has to be that emotion, that need, that is in that mind frame, yeah.

**Isn’t it kind of scary to put yourself out there like that?**

**Elena:** I suppose, yes. But I try not to think too much about it. That might be why I write the things I do the way I do. ‘Cause I’m not really in that moment thinking about the people listening to it. I’m thinking about documenting and saying what I have to at the time. And I suppose that when it becomes a song, it’s sort of.. kind of less… how do you say it? It’s not as weird?

**Igor:** Rationalized? Less personal?

**Elena:** Yeah! And it’s not until someone then says “uhm this line is really weird”, that you’re like: oh god, yes it is. (laughs)

**Have you ever read the reviews of your previous releases?**

 **Elena:** Yeah some. I think they were positive. But our managers always sends them to us. I think he only sends us the good ones (laughs). But no, actually, I really try not to do that. Because it can affect the way that you write, if you pay too much attention to other people’s opinions. And I think we did really well with this album, that we definitely buried ourselves away.

**Elena, Igor, what is it like to play in a band with the one you love? Doesn’t that affect the music?**

**Igor:** No, I think we keep it quite separate, as best as we can.

**Elena:** Yeah, I think in a positive way. It’s quite nice to work with somebody that you can be completely honest with, and that you trust. ‘Cause you can be ruthless about things.

**What does it feel like when you see people singing the words to your music? When you notice that people actually listen to your music, that they love it?**

**Elena:** I still find it very surprising, it makes me laugh. Not in a bed way, but quite overwhelming. It’s one of the best feelings, I think, to have people on your side and supporting you. Especially for us. We’re not very comfortable with being in front of other people. So it’s nice to have an audience that came to see you, and that they find something in your music that they can relate to.

**Were you excited when 4AD wanted to sign you? And how do you feel now looking back on working together?**

**Igor:** Yeah definitely. ‘Cause when we started, 4AD was definitely in the back of our minds. And we’re very satisfied, they left us a lot of freedom. They’ve been very sensible in the way that they approached us, ‘cause we don’t like to overdo things. It’s been really good, and everyone is really nice as well.

**What would you say is the most memorable experience of Daughter so far?**

**Elena:** Whoah, there’s plenty!

**Igor:** Definitely Letterman. It was a stressful experience that marked us all. We were kind of reluctant to do it at first, but it was really great!

**Remi:** For me, it was like… We played this festival in Denmark. So we took a plane, and the same night we played at one o’clock in the morning, and then we flew back to London. And as we came back to London, I was so tired, and everything has been happening quickly, and suddenly you kind of wonder if it was real. It was incredible.

**Igor:** So, the US-tour?

**Elena:** Yeah! You know, we’ve been really lucky about having all these really incredible moments. We’ve only been a band for two years, you know. So it’s kind of crazy, if you look back on things. There are too many to pick one. But I’m really proud and pleased that we finished this album. I think that is an achievement for us.

**What was it like supporting Benjamin Francis Leftwich during his Autumn tour? Why did he ask you guys to do the supporting act?**

**Elena:** Well I actually met him a very long time ago. He was going under a different name back then, I’m not sure if I can say it and if he wants people to know. (laughs) But I remember his songs and his voice. It was really interesting to me, and he was a really nice guy. Actually, it was just the two (looks at Igor) of us that went on tour that time. And we took a train everywhere, followed him around. I remember that time really well. It was a very fun time, but it was also kind of stressful to run from one train to another, with a guitar and a suitcase and loads of stuff.

**Igor:** Yeah, he’s such an adorable guy!

**Elena:** Yeah, he is. He’s still so supportive of us. He’s kind of texting us and wishing us well. He’s lovely.

**Are you nervous before a gig?**

All: All the time! Always.

**Do you have any crazy rituals before getting on stage, to make sure everything will go as planned?**

**Remi:** High five, have a beer. (laughs)

**Elena:** I have to just…not talk to anyone for a while. (laughs) But not really, as if yet. Maybe we’ll make one up (smiles).

**Van Halen once requested on their rider that a bowl of M&Ms would be provided in their dressing room with the brown ones removed. Do you have such requests on your rider?**

**Elena:** Hahaha, no!

**Igor:** Well, maybe! We generally ask some vodka or rum, or one of the two. And then we end up with 20 bottles of alcohol, but it’s always the same kind. But I have this idea of sending different requests every night, and then we’ll have like a proper bar.

**Elena:** Oh yeah, a bar with local alcohol! That would be really cool!

**Where would you like to see yourself/the band five years from now?**

**Igor:** Alive, as Elena would say.

**Elena:** I don’t know. I’d still like to see us as a band, or even just individually. Still kind of making music, and enjoying it. And not feeling sort of numb or detached from the feeling that we have now. I don’t want it to become a routine.

**Igor:** Yeah, just keep on caring.

**Would you quit the band if you felt like you stopped caring?**

**Elena:** Probably, yeah.

**Igor:** Yeah, the reason we’re doing it, is because it feels good. It’s fun, you’re with friends. It would always have to be something that I enjoy doing.

**If there was one, rather unknown artist you could recommend to our readers, who would it be?**

**Igor:** Evenings! It’s an American electronic band.

**Elena:** Hmmm. Well, I wanna say one, but it’s kind of cheesy. Because it’s something that Igor introduced me to. It’s not really unknown though.

**Igor:** Evenings, evenings!

**Elena:** Okay, so we’ll go with Evenings.

**Igor:** Baths is also kinda cool.

**Elena:** Yeah, Baths.

**Remi:** Twin!

**Igor:** Oh yeah, Twin, we should say that. She’s playing at Botanique tonight.

**Remi:** She’s one of our friends. She’s from Belgium, but I met her in London. Yeah, check her out online. She’s pretty interesting.

**Which other bands do you admire?**

**Igor:** Evenings!

**Elena:** (laughs) Well, I kind of like Sun Glitters, from Luxemburg. but then again, he’s kind of unknown.

**Are there any bands that inspired you to start writing?**

**Elena:**  Oh yeah. For me, it was Jeff Buckley. And later on I think we all kind of found Sigur Ros interesting. And Radiohead for you, yeah Igor?

**Igor:** Yeah. It’s hard. I think Elena was the one really into Jeff Buckley.

**Elena:** Yeah, I had a moment!

**A Jeff-Buckley-moment.**

**Elena:** Yeah, exactly! (laughs)

**Igor:** But there are quite a lot of bands, I guess.

**You have performed in Belgium twice already? How did you enjoy Pukkelpop?**

**Elena:** I still have my wristband on. (shows me the pukkelpop bracelet) It’s the only one that survived. I really loved it, it was great!

**Igor:** Yeah, it was surprising, the amount of people that were there. We didn’t expect to play such a big tent. But maybe it’s not that big of a tent for Pukkelpop.

**Do you prefer festivals or small shows?**

**Elena:** There’s not really preferences. But they’re quite different, yeah.

**Remi:** Festivals are more laid back. Everyone’s there to have a good moment. That’s a sort of relief, ‘cause we feel a bit more pressure when we’re playing a smaller gig. If you play like Botanique, people stand in front of you, and you can actually feel kind of scrutinized. See them looking in your eyes, watching your every move, waiting for you to make a mistake or something. But at festivals, it’s not like that. There’s just like, people in the back, having a beer.

**I think it’s a great accomplishment to have people listening to such intimate music at festivals.**

**Elena:** Yeah, I’m really glad you said that! It’s really nice for us to have this kind of quiet festival crowds.

**Do you mind being away from home when touring?**

**Elena:** Not really. Honestly, our home is maybe slightly easy to leave. ‘Cause we live in a not very nice flat (laughs). So we’re like ‘that’s fine”. But there’s obviously an element of missing your family and friends. And that’s not only when we’re away. Sometimes we can get quite consumed in our work. During the course of the album, it became pretty anti-social for, like, a whole year. But it’s interesting, when we really put our minds on something. But I like travelling. I haven’t, in my life, really been able to travel that much. So, yes, it’s nice to have this adventure and see the world.

**And how do your friends and family react to your success?**

**Elena:** My friends are great. They’re very funny, they have a lot of humour about it. Sometimes they come to shows, and they’re really enjoying it. My dad and brother came to see us once, and my brother’s not really into our kind of music, he’s more into rock. But it was nice to see him enjoying it and saying things like “it was great!”

**Will we be seeing you again this summer?**

**Elena:** We’re gonna be back in April! (Botanique)

**Igor:** The summer is still being confirmed the next month. But hopefully more than once this year!

**Elena:** Yeah I really hope so.

**Remi:** Guys, it’s super cheesy. I’ve been thinking about saying this for minutes, when you asked the question about being away from home. I’m gonna say it. It’s certainly easier to know that I’m doing this with friends. It’s a fun experience. It feels like home, a little bit. It’s pretty bad that I have to call hotel rooms home, but yeah.

**Elena:** Ooh! The suitcase is our home.

**What does 2013 have in store for Daughter?**

**Igor:** The new album, and lots of touring.

**Elena:** And hopefully, within the touring, there will be lots of writing! Hopefully.

**Do you have any new songs already?**

**Elena:** Oh, we have a very, very rough demo thing ready. But nothing sharable just yet. (laughs)

**Can’t wait!**
