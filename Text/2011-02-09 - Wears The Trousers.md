Since we last posted about Elena Tonra (aka Daughter) back in December, her demos EP has found its way into plenty of eager ears. ‘Run’ in particular made big waves on Hype Machine, reaching #3 in their ‘Popular’ chart. With work ongoing on her debut EP proper and more great live shows in the offing (see below for all the info), we thought we ought to get to know Elena a bit better so we asked her to fill out our trusty questionnaire. Here the self-professed oddball tells us about her early ambitions to do “something grim”, her dubious cleaning tips and how she got a scar on her eyebrow.

* * *

### If you could star in any TV show, past or current, which would it be and what kind of character would you play?

‘Columbo’! I’d be a crafty murderer…but never crafty enough! Damn you Columbo!

### What is your most loved item of clothing and why is it so treasured?

I have this red knitted cardigan, it was my great-grandmother’s and has been passed down to me. I love it very much.

### What did you listen to when you were growing up?

I used to listen to a lot of different types of music really. My parents listened to the likes of Bowie, Dylan, Neil Young, all the greats! And I loved it when they’d play vinyls in the living room. I felt like I’d travelled back in time, to a time I have no idea about, but I think you get the feeling through the sound of the music. I used to sit in the car and sing along to all the songs on the radio. I used to study songs so intensely, making sure I got every single line of melody exactly replicating the original. Odd child. Odd adult, to be fair.

### What’s your earliest memory?

I have a really bad memory but I can clearly remember cutting my eyebrow open on a Fisher-Price torch when I was about four (my brother hit me in the face with it by accident). I now have a scar.

### What’s your tipple?

My tipple is ever-changing. Mainly because I can’t choose. So I have them all.

### Tell us about your favourite instrument.

I only have one instrument, my guitar. I received her as a gift. She was bought with money that my father was given from his uncle when he died. I have a great attachment to her because of that. Her name is TJ, after him.

### If you were the answer to a crossword puzzle, what would be your clue?

Windswept and interesting (10).

### What did you want to be until you decided to become a musician…if you ever did ‘decide’ that is!

I really wanted to be a forensic scientist when I was younger, but was always just that little bit shit at science. Or a criminologist…something grim.

### What would you be if you weren’t a musician?

Completely lost.

### What’s your top household tip?

Sweep it under the carpet…

### What are your pet hates?

People that spit on the floor for no reason…unless it’s a spitting competition. But if you’re entering a spitting competition I’m probably not going to like you.

### What’s the biggest guilty pleasure in your record collection?

I have the “Essential R&B” compilation, just in case I fancy a little bit of Wu-Tang Clan’s ‘Gravel Pit’…

### What’s the biggest achievement of your career so far?

I think being involved in the Communion Records compilation. That was such an amazing record to be a part of and I was really surprised to be asked. And it’s limited edition on vinyl…so that makes it even more special.

### What’s your biggest fear?

I have quite a few. Heights are not great. I hate the dark. I always sleep with a light on, unless someone else is with me – then I’m fine.

### What’s the biggest problem facing the world today and do you have any ideas on how it could be addressed?

Out of time dancing…unfortunately for some people there is no cure.

### Do you have an instrument you’d still like to learn? What’s stopping you?

I’d love to learn piano. But I can’t read music. I’ve composed a few songs on piano but I’d love to be able to just whip out a little Mozart now and again.

### Are you multi-lingual? Have you ever written a song that wasn’t in English?

I used to speak Italian. But due to lack of practice I’ve forgotten it. I’ve never tried to write a song in Italian. I don’t think I could now it wouldn’t be very good. “Hello. How are you, can I have directions to the post office.”

### What were you like at school?

‘The nose-bleed child’

### Would you rather see a ghost or simply have a piece of toast and watch the evening news?

GHOST!! Definitely. I’d like to see the Ghost of Christmas Future! So I’d know if I need to change anything this year…if I’m all alone with a piece of toast next Christmas I think it’s time to start re-thinking my plans.

### What have you done today to make you feel proud?

Answered these questions!
