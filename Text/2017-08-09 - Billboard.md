Neo-folk group Daughter have a reputation for experimenting beyond normal conventions, but on their latest project, they are expanding their repertoire to include video game compositions. Life is Strange: Before The Storm from Square Enix, the publishers behind a host of groundbreaking series including Final Fantasy and Tomb Raider, will consist of an original score from the London-based trio.

In an exclusive behind-the-scenes look of the score’s development, Daughter members Elena Tonra and Igor Haefeli discuss the challenges of approaching a video game score and seeking inspiration from the game’s 16-year old protagonist.

“Feeling slightly under qualified but incredibly excited we learned as we went,” singer Elena Tonra tells Billboard. ”For our own albums it can take a couple of years to finish a record, so we had to be very instinctive and decisive with these songs whilst being open to adapting to fit with the script and the game as it was developing.”

The band worked almost non-stop for the first half of 2017 writing and recording the score with Tonra and Haefeli plugging away in a rented studio together while drummer Remi Aguilella recorded his parts from his home base in Portland, Ore. Despite the long distance collaborating, Tonra proudly declares “it sounds really together.”

Before The Storm is actually the perfect fit for a contemporary band to accompany as it revolves around a relatable teenage rebel in a modern, real-world story. The video game series began in 2015 with Life Is Strange, and the latest offering will serve as an episodic prequel, split into three parts. Along with filling out the story’s mythology and time-bending themes, the new installment aims to keep the series grounded in an accessible storyline. At times, Tonra saw the series’ adherence to reality in her own writing for the score.

“There are a few songs where I started writing from the main character Chloe’s perspective and slowly finding myself morphing the song into one of my own teenage memories or talking about her grief and relating it to someone I miss terribly,” Tonra tells *Billboard*. “I would get to the end of the song and think ‘Oh dear. I’m talking about that person again’ but it made it an unexpectedly therapeutic experience.”

The first release from the soundtrack [“Burn It Down”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XIRj_Iq3cw) was released Tuesday (Aug. 8). The rousing track signals a massive leap for the band, but also suggests a score that will be unlike anything else in the video game world.

Music From Before The Storm will serve as the official soundtrack and will be available Sept. 1 via Glassnote Records. The band will also be hitting the road later this year with The National in October followed by a South American headlining tour set for November.

Meanwhile, part one of Life is Strange: Before The Storm will be available on Aug. 31. More details on the series can be found on its website [here](https://www.lifeisstrange.com/). Check out an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Daughter working on the video game score below.
