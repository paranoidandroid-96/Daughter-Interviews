# DAUGHTER
## Heart of This Nation

I can’t remember the first time I heard Daughter, but I do know that I was transfixed, that I stared at the stereo for minutes, trying to understand where such music could possibly be coming from in this day and (in my case) aged.

Which is worrying as I was probably driving.

Needless to say, that within a few bars I was hooked and over the last couple of years you could probably call me ‘avid’.

All of which made it sweeter to be able to have a chat with Igor Haeflis, their innovative and rather dashingly cool guitarist, producer and genuine top chap. I tried not to fawn though, it is a bit of an embarrassing trait in the aged, let’s face it.

So, determined to keep my hard man of the press cred intact, **I asked Igor how Daughter got together as a band?**

“I met Elena at Musical School in London although we didn’t start working together until after our time at the school had finished. I’d come over from Switzerland for the course.”

**Tell us about the recording of ‘His Young Heart’, what gear were you using?**

“We recorded the first EP, quite literally in my bedroom. Romy had joined us as a drummer and we had been doing loads of gigs. We were lucky to support John Grant and Ben Howard which taught us a lot and made us tighter and obviously played to bigger crowds. The gear I was using was really simple, I DI’d the guitar and we used Logic Effects. Not many pedals then, just a Keeley Modded Boss Blues Driver and a TC Electronics Hall of Fame.”

**And now?**

“Now it is much the same apart from I have a Roland Space Echo and Elena bought me a EHX Memory Man with Hazarai Reverse Delay.” 

**You recorded a couple of EPs before you signed with 4AD. By that point you were already headlining decent sized venues, how did the signing come about?**

“Originally we signed a publishing deal and there seemed to be lots of labels buzzing around. The publisher invited 4AD to a gig we were doing in St Martin’s in the Field in London, but even then, it took a long time. 4AD were talking about working with us for the long term, nurturing whereas most were talking about getting things out quickly, and they just seemed the right label for the way we wanted to work. They have been brilliant and have always had a good reputation.”

**Thinking of other bands reading this, how did you go about building your audience?**

“We just played loads and loads of gigs and eventually people come to watch. Old fashioned but it still works and people seem to want to see what you do next.”

**All of which brings us to the release of your first album “If You Leave”, but just before that you find yourself playing the Letterman show. How did that happen and what were you thinking when it came about?**

“It was almost embarrassing. We just got asked to do it and thought WTF we hadn’t even got a record out with 4AD yet and so we nearly turned it down. But the label said we would be “batshit mental” and so we did it and it was crazy.”

**How did you come to work with Joe Duddell on the “4AD Sessions E.P.**

“We had done Festival #6 in Wales and Joe had been the in-house composer, working to put the choirs and bands together with strings and everything. It worked really well, as Joe has this real rock sensibility and his engineering was brilliant. So when we were doing the E.P we decided we would ask Joe to come in and collaborate and get the strings on there. We really hope to do more collaborations with Joe it let us explore something completely different but still - us.”

**How was the recording of “Not To Disappear?**

“We recorded NTD in our own studio in the Limehouse Factory between everything else over the whole of 2014. Elena had worked on a new style of writing and we were going a little bit crazy trying to find a new sound. It was good but hard work.

**NTD has a harder edge to it than IYL, more aggressive and almost nasty - had somebody pissed you all off?**

“It was definitely a darker album, but sometimes you have to go there if the lyrics are driving you that way, to convey the ideas in sound as well as the words.”

**Before I let you go, I’ve loved the films - how much input have you (as a band) had with them, and is it an area you would like to work more in? “**

”Ian and Jane did the videos, they were filmed over 3 days and they had got a short story writer to write stories based on the songs. It is something we will do more of as it is really interesting to see where these things go when other people take them from you.”

**So what comes next?**

“We are touring until the end of November and then we are going to take the first half of 2017 off and just do some different things.”
