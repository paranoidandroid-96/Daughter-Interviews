Elena Tonra 21, from Watford is a solo singer who has just started working on her new band, Daughter. 
Despite being unsigned Elena has been receiving radio play on 6 Music and reached number 3 of the Hype Machine chart.

Take one look and a quick listen to Elena Tonra and you could be forgiven for bunching her in the same category as the Laura Marling’s of this world, but don’t judge too quickly. ‘I don’t really like being referred to as a singer/songwriter so that’s why I decided to start the band, Daughter, so that I had a project I could work on with someone else,’ explains Elena. ‘I’m quite an awkward and shy person. I used to perform on my own but I suffer quite badly with nerves and I felt a bit lonely up on stage on my own which is why I decided to team up with Igor, my guitarist. We met each other at music college in Kilburn a few years ago so he already knew what my music was like. Since we’ve teamed up things seem to be going pretty well for the band.’ 

Back in November Daughter released their first four track EP which caught the attention of the music heads over at 6 Music and the two have subsequently received airplay on the station. ‘The EP was received really well and we’ve had some lovely feedback from blogs. I’m not signed yet so it’s great for me to be getting radio play on something as big as 6 Music,’ says Elena. Elena has also teamed up with influential label Communion Records on a couple of projects including a compilation CD which also featured the likes of Mumford and Sons and Daughter will be representing them later this month during the HMV Next Big Thing gig at Boarderline where Elena will play alongside Andrew Davie – ‘I’m a huge fan of his, I love him’ – and Marcus Foster, a far cry from her first gig, ‘It was in a pub in North Harrow and it was full of underage drinkers. I was so nervous that I couldn’t even play properly,’ she says. ‘I’m going to make 2011 all about the live music and I want to try and do as many gigs as I can. When artists are starting out I think it’s really important to gig as much as possible, for me it really helped withmy confidence,’ she says. 

Despite the obvious attention being gained by Elena’s music she remains unsigned and still works almost full time in John Lewis, something she hopes will change soon. ‘I don’t really know if I’m any nearer to being signed but I hope I am soon. I’d love to do this as my full time career,’ says Elena. So how does Elena think she differs from other people in the ‘nu-folk’ category? ‘I don’t really like that expression,’ she says. ‘I don’t think most of the people in the ‘nu-folk’ category even want to be in it. I’ve been lucky enough to meet and perform on the same nights as the likes of Jonny Flynn and Mumford and Sons but while I love their styles of folk music I don’t really think I’m part of it. I’m sort of an outsider looking in thinking their all really cool and that I don’t really belong around them.’ 

What’s the best thing about the London music scene? \
