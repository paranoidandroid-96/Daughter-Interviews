WORDS Alana Ryan

It was, by all accounts, a pretty miserable evening. Dark and damp, the rain was drizzling down in a thoroughly Irish fashion. January was excelling at sucking all joy out of the soul, to the extent that had it not been a Daughter gig I probably would have stayed put, tea in hand, hunched as close to the open fire as is humanly possible, muttering my malcontent to all those unfortunate enough to come directly into my vicinity. In retrospect, this would have been a terrible mistake. As concerts go, it was one of the best.

The Button Factory, packed to capacity, throbbed with energy; people swayed and stomped, singing along emphatically to lyrics which they seemed to claim as their own. Such was their glee that at times the singer’s soft vocals were drowned out by the crowd’s raucous enthusiasm for a singalong.

Given Elena Tonra’s nervous giggles and shy thanks, one can hazard the guess that this isn’t the typical reception the British act usually receives. Two weeks later, the young singer laughs at the memory of it. “It was absolutely great, actually we had a really good time.” The crowd weren’t too much then? “Well it was different than a lot of the tour, because we’d been in churches, and so everyone was quite well behaved.” Variety is, as they say, the spice of life.

Daughter is the latest “folk” act to gain popular acclaim. But the threesome: Elena, Igor and Remi, are much more exciting than the genre’s current poster boys. A far cry from Mumford and Sons, Noah and the Whale, or even Laura Marling, Daughter’s music is suffused with emotion – the anxieties of youth dragged from a dark corner and placed centre stage. Melodies soar and retreat, accompanied by whimsical ornamentation and touches of electronica and eerie percussion. The frailty of the human condition has rarely been captured in such an achingly beautiful way.

To tar them with the same brush that was pulled out for The Lumineers doesn’t seem to do Daughter justice. “Yeah we’ve always had that [folk comparison], perhaps due to my earlier stuff. I think there is a folk element in terms of the writing still being poetry-based . . . but folk is perhaps more traditional than we are.”

Their debut album If You Leave, due for release this month, is a definite expansion in sound from the two previous EPs. Production was predominantly done by Igor, but with a little help from The XX’s producer Rodaidh McDonald, and Jolyon Vaughan, who’s worked with Maps. Mixing was courtesy of Ken Thomas, known for his collaborations with Sigur Ros and M83.

The advance in sound is definitely discernible. One of the standout tracks, Still, is a perfect exercise in merging the delicate notes of Daughter’s trademark sparse vocal with atmospheric reverb and chilling ambient harmonics, while Tomorrow’s sombre images are set against alluring echoes and resolute percussion strikes, which give dynamic depth. Elena is generous in her praise: “They’re really great people and very open. It was a good working relationship that Igor had with them.” She pauses briefly then cheerfully admits “We weren’t so much clear how we really wanted it to come out but we were very clear on how we didn’t want it to come out.”

Despite this increased professionalism in production, the songs still retain their story-telling emphasis. As mini-narratives, Daughter’s music always excels at capturing the vulnerability of youth, complete with all its frightening uncertainty and perpetual curiosity. Death and spirituality are omnipresent on the new album, with many of the tracks alluding to the afterlife. On Smother the singer softly states that “In the darkness I will meet my creators,” while on earlier song The Woods attention is drawn to Saint Christopher. Does Elena identify with religion? “Well, I’d be interested in that side of things, I was brought up in a religious family but I’m not very religious in terms of organisation or in terms of the church . . . But that doesn’t mean I won’t be religious in the future – I have no idea, but I’m just really interested. I wonder all the time what happens after you die, do you see other people again or is that just it.” She trails off, lost in thought for a fleeting second before curiously stating “Sometimes I look up conspiracy theories; I’m quite interested in the supernatural.” We mull over this for short while, leaving Elena to wryly quip “You can never run out of things to say about death or about after you die or about aliens.”

    SONGWRITING IS DEFINITELY A KIND OF THERAPY. IF I COULDN’T WRITE I’D BE LIKE A NERVOUS WRECK. IT’S GOOD TO GET ALL THOSE BAD FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS OUT

While the singer may be intrigued by the extraterrestrial her main thematic pillar is something a lot closer to home: love in all its guises. Earlier songs such as Landfill and Home capture the rawness of rejection with alarming accuracy. It would seem that music is a cathartic exercise for the young singer. “It’s definitely a kind of therapy. If I couldn’t write I’d be like a nervous wreck. It’s good to get all those bad feeling and thoughts out and I think it definitely helps. But in terms of content, some lyrics are from that dark place which I think everyone has  . . . and I try and get into that place.” She elaborates that she’s been a keen chronicler since she was just thirteen: “Whenever I found things difficult I tried to write and it does help and I just carried on. For me [originally] it was less about making music and more about the need to write.”

Bizarrely, when I ask what kind of music she was into at that time, it’s revealed in a rather roundabout way that the defining album of her early adolescence was the soundtrack to the 2001 Sci Fi Tom Cruise classic Vanilla Sky. Yes, I was surprised too. Elena, clearly relishing this trip down memory lane, divulges that it was in fact her dad who instigated this anomalous appreciation. “He’s really interested into music . . . he just heard on a radio show that it was a really good album and went and bought it. None of us had seen the film; it actually took us two or three years to watch it.”

However, Tom Cruise didn’t live up to the hype, Elena admits laughing heartily: “We liked the soundtrack way more than the film.” The album does sound pretty good. Featuring the likes of REM, The Chemical Brothers, Radiohead, Bob Dylan, and Sigur Ros, it’s easy to see how it could capture the imagination of an eager teenager. Elena readily confirms that “As an introduction to a few bands I’d never heard of before like Sigur Ros, it was definitely a good thing.”

As our conversation draws to a close, I remark how clean and memorable the one-word titles are. Short and to the point, they remain etched on my memory long after the final chords gently fade away. While Elena initially jocularly notes it makes writing the set list on her hand all the more manageable, a more considered answer emerges after a short reflection. “I think what we like about [the titles] is that they leave it quite open to people to interpret the songs as they want. I don’t want to explain too much, I want people to have their own opinion . . . to decide what they like about it.” People will undoubtedly diverge in their individual interpretation, but there’s common consensus that Daughter are one of the most beguiling and beautiful bands to emerge in recent times.

If You Leave is out 18th March 2013.
