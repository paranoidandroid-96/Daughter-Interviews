BRINGING the sparse and emotionally brittle sounds of their critically lauded and commercially successful debut album to the stage has been a rare challenge in a remarkably successful year for British three-piece Daughter.

Since the release of If You Leave last March the band have toured extensively, and lead singer and songwriter Elena Tonra said they were looking forward to demonstrating a refined sound in their shows at St Jerome's Laneway Festival in Rozelle and at St Stephen's Uniting Church on Macquarie St.

"The way the album came about was a bit strange in the fact that we hadn't played the newer songs live," she said from London shortly before heading to Singapore for the first leg of Laneway.

"It was a case of recording ideas and working out what sounds cool without knowing what would work live or even whether we could do it live.

"We've added a fourth musician because we really wanted to sound full and not like a stripped down version. It feels like we're representing the record well but it's hopefully not exactly the same as the recorded version, it's nice to have that difference."

Tonra's lyrics, often bleak, poetic and concerned with the loss of love, are a critical component of the band's sound and she said they flow freely even though she isn't always the most prolific of songwriters.

"When I write -maybe this is strange - I tend to not go back and re-edit words if they sound too depressing or anything like that," she said.

"It's a way to portray a certain thing but not the exact details of a memory, I'm not telling everyone about specific people or events, it's a bit more ambiguous and so it's a bit easier to present it to an audience.

"But I have been caught out a few times, it does depend on my mood. If I'm in a very fragile state then I might have an embarrassing crying moment on stage but most of the time that doesn't happen."

Tonra added that her and band mates Igor Haefeli (guitar) and Remi Aguilella (drums) were impressed by Laneway's line-up, pinpointing King Krule, Chvrches and Kurt Vile as must-see acts, and she said they hope to take advantage of the touring nature of the festival to explore Australia and New Zealand.
