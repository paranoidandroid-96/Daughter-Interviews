It is hard to fanthom the level of anticipation that seems to have coalesced around If You Leave, the debut record for Daughter, a trio that have taken the spectral skeleton of traditional pop and folk compositions and weaved a darker, atmospheric world for themselves with astonishing results. The rise and fall of the gossamer guitar lines by Igor Haefeli and understated yet pivotal drumming of Remi Aguilella provide this esoteric sonic backdrop, yet everything hinges on the ethereal, haunted vocals of Elena Tonra. Embodying both fragility and power, Tonra is a beguiling presence, imbuing Daughter with a mesmeric countenance that is hypnotic and alluring. The fact that a band without a debut record could find themselves playing on The Late Show With David Letterman is a defining signifier of what Daughter is capable of.

If You Leave has been heralded in the press as a long time coming, what with the brewing adulation garnered from their previous EPs, His Young Heart and The Wild Youth, feeling like the calm before the storm. Yet The Wild Youth came out at the tail end of 2011, and the pressure of releasing a longplayer has been something that Tonra has been attuned to yet assuages that there were no problems leading up to it.

"It really came down to ensuring we had a whole lot of new songs for it; and whilst it looks like we had a year to make it, we had a lot of touring in between," Tonra explains. "It was this juggling act between writing and recording and being away. It took this time due to practical reasons over anything else. We wanted to take our time and not rush out and knock up something that was like the EP songs smooshed together. The weird thing is, when you look at all the things that have been in front of us over the year, we actually worked quite speedily to get everything to come together as they have, especially for us."

If You Leave is a culmination of a burgeoning creative force that found its genesis in the bedroom and at open mic nights. Tonra says that while she has never shied away from writing songs with others, it wasn't until her chance meeting with Haefeli that she realised what she had been missing.

"His Young Heart came quite early, so we were working within our means, we only had a few guitars and a few mics, we were only working each other out," Tonra admits. "I was always quite conscious when playing solo that I was quite limited with what I wanted to project, because there was only me and a guitar. And whilst I wasn't actively looking for people to play with, I felt restricted and knew that I had to express these songs inanother way. So when I met Igor I knew straight away; he had this completely different approach to music and I was interested in the way he works and writes and plays. Then Remi came on board, and by the time we made The Wild Youth things were well in place for us as a trio; we could see how things worked, how we could arrange songs. Even so, we've had these ideas on what we've wanted to do and it's only now that we feel we have realised them fully. It takes a certain amount of confidence to show someone your lyrics, to bare that side of yourself."

The curious thing is that Tonra's lyrics are incredibly sparse and honest, with no holds barred when expressing her perceived insecurities, both from within and without. The subject matter, dealing with quite insular insecurities and fears, often overshadows the atmospheric mood that Haefeli and Aguilella meticulously create to the point that it makes for incredibly uncomfortable listening, to hear such emotional flaying offered by a smoky, disembodied voice. While proving to be quite personal, Tonra admits she never considered how her lyrics might reflect on her.

"When we wrote the album I didn't really think about (the lyrics) because we were very much in a solitary area, we kept to ourselves as much as we could during that year. We were making this album for ourselves in a way, so we weren't thinking about what other people would think about it. It's only now that I'm thinking "Oh shit, why am I telling everyone these things?" But in my opinion you need to be honest; it's the way I have always written, it's a way to get rid of all the bad feelings or dark emotions that can build up inside. It's always been a way to deal with things. And for us we never really went out much, we didn't see people, the whole process consumed us. It was heavy - an enjoyable experience, but something of a challenge. So when the reviews come out and start picking everything apart it's quite strange. Who knows what my future songwriting will be like, seeing that I might be self-conscious about it all now; maybe it's destroyed me!"

Whilst there have been moments where Daughter's musical oeuvre, as embryonic as it is, has been labelled as folk, yet there are few glaring touchstones on If You Leave that lend themselves to such pigeonholing. Although Tonra herself doesn't align herself to a folk aesthetic, she believes there are elements, such as the honesty of the lyrics, that connect with people in a similar way, providing universal truths that ultimately become the hook that draws people in. "I wouldn't know how to describe our music! It's definitely got that songwriting quite present within it. Maybe it's the way the lyrics presents themselves to people that makes think we're folky, but I don't really have an answer. We are definitely a lot more electric, a lot darker in that sound."

It is the day of the launch in the UK (March 18), a day of a number of firsts for the band. Tonra admits that each goal is a life dream, yet they are staying as firmly realistic as they can. "We are actually just getting ready to travel to Brighton to do our first instore, which is a little daunting," Tonra laughs. "It's a bit of a nervewracking celebration. We really want people to love our live shows more than our albums to be honest, because we have always seen ourselves as a live band. It's something we take quite seriously, to be a good live band as opposed to a mediocre live band with some good songs. So I'm a bit precious and nervous about these things. Other than that we don't think that far ahead, we like to keep the slate clean. So for today...we'll play the instore and then I'll probably get drunk somewhere, just to pass the day."
