# DAUGHTER
## FEW ARTISTS HAVE MADE THEIR MARK ON 2013 AS ADEPTLY AS DAUGHTER, THE THREE-PIECE EXTRAPOLATION OF ELENA TONRA'S GHOSTLY SONGWRITING.
## HER ST GEORGE'S HALL SELLOUT IN JANUARY WAS ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER TICKETS OF THE YEAR AND (BAR AN IN-STORE AT RISE) THIS MONTH SEES HER TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO THE BRISTOL AREA - WITH THE STUNNING DEBUT FULL-LENGTH IF YOU LEAVE UNDER HER BELT.

**SO ELENA, YOU'RE BACK THIS MONTH - LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AFTER JANUARY'S SELLOUT? ARE SHOWS A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE SINCE AUDIENCES HAVE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO HEAR THE ALBUM?**
Yes, we're very much looking forward to returning to Bristol, we've had some very fun times there! I suppose it is a bit different now - it's really cool to see people getting into the album songs.

**CONGRATS ON IF YOU LEAVE'S RECENT AIM AWARD, IS INDEPENDENT MUSIC SOMETHING YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT? DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE STRUCK A GOOD BALANCE WITH 4AD/GLASSNOTE?**
Thank you! I think we're very lucky to be working with two incredible independent labels. It was something we were always passionate about; we really wanted to do a lot of things ourselves and to have a lot of freedom whilst working on our first album. Both labels really left us to our own creative devices, but were advice, always there if we needed which was really great. Weve also been really lucky to work with the 'in-house' videographers at Beggars/4AD for our music videos, and I really love their visions for each song!

**YOU'VE SEEMED ALMOST SURPRISED AT THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT YOU'VE GOTTEN FROM FESTIVAL CROWDS THIS SUMMER, HAS IT BEEN OVERWHELMING HOW MANY PEOPLE'S IMAGINATIONS YOUR MUSIC HAS CAPTURED?**

Yes, it has been very surprising how many people have come to see us at festivals. We're not really a typical festival kind of band, so we didn't expect such a great reaction! And it's a very personal record for me, so it's overwhelming to see people connecting with it.

**YOU'VE MENTIONED BEFORE JEFF BUCKLEY'S GRACE BEING A TURNING POINT IN WHAT MUSIC MEANT TO YOU... YOUR MUSIC HAS A SIMILAR EERIE SINCERITY, DO YOU HOPE IT MIGHT DO THE SAME THING FOR OTHER PEOPLE?**

Oh Jesus! I can only hope so. I don't think 'If You Leave' is any way near as confident as 'Grace', so I doubt it would have the same immediate "this sh\*t is life-changing!" feeling that I had at fifteen, listening to it for the first time! I think our album is a lot more desolate and well, bleak, so I hope that somewhere in there, there's something to escape into. But I think it's different now, there are so many different ways to find music and new artists that inspire you. When I was fifteen I'd exhausted my parents' (incredible) record collection and was listening to either the radio or what my brother was into, and trying to figure out what I liked - apart from R&B compilations with Destiny's Child on... So I think 'Grace' filled a massive void in guitar based music that I could appreciate at that time, and Jeff Buckley's voice was instantly all-consuming.
