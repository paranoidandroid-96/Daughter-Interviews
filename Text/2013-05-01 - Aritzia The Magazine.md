To celebrate the North American release of their quietly stunning debut, If You Leave, London trio Daughter played two sold-out shows at New York’s Bowery Ballroom, the second of which, on May 1st, we documented. “It was daunting!” pint-sized singer-guitarist Elena Tonra recalls a couple of weeks later. “I was pretty nervous, but the audiences both nights were so welcoming and really enthusiastic.” Indeed, as soon as the band took the stage and Tonra began to play the delicate guitar part of “Shallows,” their album’s hushed and emotional closer, the crowd grew silent and focused. They were there to be moved—and Daughter delivered. ELLEN CARPENTER

## Slide 1
>“We don’t have any crazy preshow ritual—no yoga moves or breathing exercises. We’ll go into our own little spaces…. And then maybe we’ll have a drink to calm down.”

## Slide 2
>“Our setlist has been pretty much the same for this tour—I think it’s comforting to have that as a constant.”

## Slide 3
>“I tend to look down a lot at my feet, but I enjoy seeing the audiences faces. Especially when they’re singing—it’s such an incredible feeling to see people singing the words that you wrote in the bedroom by yourself. It’s pretty surreal.”

## Slide 4
>“I don’t have a favourite song to play, but ‘Youth’ and ‘Landfill’ are always really nice to play because they get a really good reaction from the crowd and people generally like to sing along. You feel like you’re connecting with the audience.”

## Slide 5
>“At a recent show, I looked out and I saw this girl crying in the audience and it really affected me. I wanted to stop the song and go and give her a hug. I should have, actually—I regret not doing that.”

## Slide 6
>“When you walk off stage, there’s definitely a buzz—a high you get from having this experience of people coming to watch you. It’s a very weird thing to do: to stand up in front of people and essentially tell them all your secrets in song. But it’s an amazing feeling.”

“I tend to look down a lot at my feet, but I enjoy seeing the audiences faces and engaging with people. Especially when they’re singing the lyrics back to you— it’s such an incredible feeling to see people singing the words that you wrote in the bedroom by yourself. It’s pretty surreal.”

I was pretty nervous for the Bowery shows. It was a little bit, you know, we felt nervous. I think they went really well. It was very exciting to be able to play that space two nights in a row. And all the people. I think it went well! It was just kind of daunting. But it went amazing! The audiences both nights were so welcoming and really enthusiastic and not [unaudible].

We’re not the most [unaudible] band in the world, we’re not the most comfortable looking onstage so it’s really nice to have some people in the audience who make you feel at ease. It was very nice.

I think it mix of both. I tend to look down a lot at my feet, but I enjoy looking up and seeing the audiences faces and engaging with people. Especially when they’re singing the lyrics back, it’s such an incredible feeling to see people singing the words that you wrote in the bedroom by yourself. And here they are singing them back to you – it’s pretty surreal. And um recently at one of the shows we were playing, I looked out and I saw this girl crying in the audience and it really affected me. I was really upset about it – I wanted to stop the song and go and stop the song and go and give her a hug. But I couldn’t really. I should have actually—I regret not doing that! That really upset me. I hope she’s all right. Hopefully she was crying in a positive way!

## Preshow? 

Not really, nothing kind of crazy. No yoga moves or anything. I don’t know. We just sort of try to calm down. We’ll go into our own little spaces; I’m sort of one who stares at stuff for a while and concentrates on what’s going through my head, what I need to do, if I’ve got everything up onstage. We write our set list down. That kind of helps us prepare. And then maybe we’ll have a drink to calm down, and just before we go on we get our little group together and like sort of give each other a bit of a confidence boost before we go on. But no crazy breathing excercises or anything. 

## Setlist

For this tour, it’s pretty much the same for the whole time. We just change around a few things at the beginning to iron out [unaudible]. It tends to be kind of the same. I think it’s comforting to have that as a constant. It’s quite nice to have a similar setlist every night. But we’ll probably change it up a bit for the rest of the tour. I quite like to get [unaudible] in [unaudible].

LP

It’s Les Paul. Igor. It’s his guitar

## Favourite song?

Umm, oh I don’t know. I think it’s been interesting to play ones from the new album, when we wrote the album, they very much made it in sort of spontaneous way, [unaudible]. It was a bit like, oh, how are we going to play this? It’s been nice to… I’ve got some crazy vocal harmonizers and vocal effects. That’s been really fun – it’s been quite different. “Youth” is always really nice to play because it always gets a really good reaction from the crowd and people generally like to sing along. And “Landfill” as well. They’re really fun to play because you feel like you’re connecting with the audience. 

## Lights

The lighting designer at the Bowery show was amazing. He wanted to know what we liked and what kind of things… I think lights make such a dramatic difference. Especially when they play with the sounds and there’s a moment even though you can’t see the full display because we’re in it, I could feel it and it was incredible. It makes a massive difference. If we could have lighting like that for every show, we would.

## Feeling off stage?

It’s a weird combination.—there’s a kind of relief. There’s definitely a buzz – there’s definitely a high you get from having the experience of people coming to watch you. It’s a very [unaudible] thing to do – stand up in front of people and essentially tell them all your secrets in song. It’s kind of weird! But it’s an amazing feeling. 

It’s actually quite nice when you make mistakes because it makes the night memorable in a way. 

## First ever show?

We played a place called the Slaughtered Lamb. Me and Igor played before that. But as the band we are now, we played the Slaughtered Lamb, it’s a basement of a pub in London. It was great. We had friends down and my cousin and my mom and dad came. It was really nice. What was really cool was that there were people there who we didn’t know and that was maybe the first time that had ever happened to us. They had heard of us through Facebook or something and decided to come down and that was really cool – We had all these familiar faces, but then some people who had just come down because they had heard of us! That was really exciting! It was the first show and the last show we ever played with [unaudible] and we played an accordion. I might have to bust that accordion out!

## Summer?

We’ve got a lot of festivals and that’s going to be exciting. I like playing our organized shows and festivals are quite free. You don’t feel as much pressure as you normally would. I’m really excited to go to Japan because we’re going for Fuji Rock and I’ve never been. And I hope I have the time to explore. And then we’re also going to Australia… And then we’re back here. There’s lots of fun stuff, I can’t really decide.
