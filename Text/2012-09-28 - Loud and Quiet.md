Whispering out from the speakers of teenage bedrooms across the land, Daughter’s anthemic ode to the heady rush of ‘Youth’ is fast becoming a Youtube covers sensation. Daughter seem oblivious to the attention, sheltered within the confines of the backstage ahead of a Beirut support slot, huddled against the driving rain outside.

With a fragile, slightly awkward beauty, lead singer Elena Tonra is both compelling and shyly disarming in her sweetness. The two boys, slightly rumpled with sleep, lounge quietly on the sofas. Previously a solo project, Eleanor was joined by her boyfriend Igor Haefeli on guitar and college friend Remi Aguilella on drums. They met while studying at The Institute of Contemporary Music Performance in London, becoming a fully fledged group just two years ago.

Softly Eleanor chimes in, “I suppose I just didn’t enjoy doing the solo shows because I find it quite scary. I first started mainly gigging with Igor, he just filled in for a few shows, then we started arranging stuff.” She adds, “It’s very difficult to get the sounds that were in my head to actually work. Remi and Igor really bring their strengths to what we have now”.

Strangely often compared to Scandinavian acts like Jonsi and Bjork, Eleanor is a London native, while Remi and Igor hail from France and Switzerland respectively, Igor also has a French mother. “I was born and raised in France and then moved to London, because I wanted to explore the scene I guess and play music. I come from a really small place in France and you see a lot of great international bands coming to those cities, but it’s pretty to see a regional band playing those really good venues. It’s pretty rare”, explains Remi.

As we get round to discussing those heartfelt Youtube covers, they look slightly taken aback when I suggest that they might prefer people to just buy the record. Eleanor whispers, “I don’t think it’s a bad thing. I haven’t really watched them too much, just because I find it quite surreal I suppose, but not really in a bad way. It is flattering I think…quite strange but good!”

Igor agrees, “I think especially that they relate to it and feel like they want to sing it. Personally when I was learning guitar the songs I really like I tried to cover”.

“Someone showed me a drum cover once of Youth, I remember going on Youtube and finding it and suddenly it’s the part you came up with being played by someone else”, Remi adds.

Eleanor gently furrows her brow beneath her heavy bangs, “Surreal…”

Remi laughs,“Exactly, surreal!”

Playing live their partnership becomes clear, communicating with shy glances and the faintest of smiles, backed by Igor’s shuddering guitars, with the technical subtlety of former jazz drummer Remi, gently weaving it all together.

As the main lyricist, many of the songs are deeply personal to Eleanor. I wonder out loud how difficult it is to share them with other people. Are there any she wouldn’t want to be heard?

Eleanor agrees, “Yes, when I think about them too much”. She hesitates, “When I don’t think about it, it’s just a song and then suddenly I think, ‘Arggh shit why am I telling everyone!’ It’s like a moment of realisation”.

Then, brushing it off with a shrug she adds, “Then I think that people already know my secrets anyway so its fine. There are days when you’re playing a song and you get reminded why you wrote it and it can upset me a little bit. But while I’m on stage I try not to get too silly about things”.

So has having others to share the songwriting process with helped? Igor answers carefully, “I think that it’s a work in progress and it’s something that will take a long time for Eleanor to feel freer to let us other people in to a song”. He adds as Eleanor laughs softly in the background, “Because she’s been so used to doing things by herself that it will only grow as the months and years go by”.

Currently writing and producing a new album, Igor is on co-producing duties with Rodaidh McDonald, who worked on both The XX records. Eleanor explains, “We’re writing quite a lot of new songs and we don’t have a huge amount of time to live with them. We’re very much going on instinct and mood, following naturally where we think it should go and they are quite dark at the moment, a bit morbid maybe. I suppose it’s maybe easier for me to write about things like that”.

Darkness certainly becomes Daughter with their previous songs like ‘Love’ carrying the biting sadness of love lost, twisted and tangled up with surging electro at its heart rending conclusion.

While ‘Home’ has the slow percussive shuffle of Feist, with all of the shuddering, enveloping sadness and none of the joyful hum. The lyrics too provide little insights into the hurt contained within, ‘I think I should be a little bit more confident in myself, in my skin’.

Taking things to a lighter place I note that a recent interview commented on the artwork featuring pictures of a young Elena and her family. They laugh at my suggestion that Remi and Igor should be next, but I’m sure they have Mums with shoeboxes of embarrassing childhood moments only too ready to oblige. Eleanor explains the importance of having a connection to her past, “In the two EPs it was really important to embarrass myself and to have that link with that silly picture with me and my brother. Maybe in a way it made it less daunting to release something that has something familiar on it, made it a bit less scary, almost. But I think a lot of the songs have a running family theme to them. I write a lot about my parents and my family so I think I should probably carry on talking about them”.  Laughing she adds “Whether or not they’ll allow me to use anymore embarrassing photos or not I don’t know. But I’d like to”.

Daughter plan to release their debut album in January, just in time for their first headline UK tour. It follows on from a two week American tour in October and one week European tour in November making for a long and busy road ahead.  Eleanor smiles, determined, “It’s not going to be easy. But, you know, pressures good, right?”

New single ‘Smother’ with its sliding guitars and lushly orchestrated harmonies hints at a break from their usual Spartan sound, while still keeping the same soul wrenching lyrics at its core; ‘Sometimes I wish I’d just stayed inside my mother, never to come out’.

Backstage the debate rages on about what songs to include. Igor emphasises, “There won’t be really many songs from the EPs. We just kind of want to keep on progressing. There might be one or two, we’re still weighing. It’s more about making something that glues together.

Eleanor interjects, “It would be a nice touch to maybe just have one song”.

Nodding, Igor agrees, “So we’re not completely denying”.

Earlier this year they released a T-Shirt for Mind through offbeat charity scheme, the Yellow Bird Project, Eleanor explains how they came to be involved, “They make T-Shirts basically that combine an artist with a charity and we were given the opportunity to choose, so we chose to work with Mind”. Suddenly she wavers, becoming slightly birdlike and fragile.

“I thought it might be a really good idea and I really wanted to choose that charity. her voice fades to a whisper. “I think it relates quite a lot to… she trails as Igor finishes off “to the project”.

Personal demons aside this year has been a confident one for Daughter. Currently on tour with Beirut, they have seen a slew of appearance at major festivals including Bestival and Latitude, and last year enjoying support slots with Cloud Control, Sharon Von Etten and Mercury Prize nominated Ben Howard, who continues to champion the band.

Often mentioned the same breath as female artists like Laura Marling, Eleanor is keen to make the distinction. “I think I’m quite different, I’m not really a girl singer. I mean I am a girl, I’m not really a woman, but it’s not really like that, it’s more of a collaborative thing”.

Igor adds, “I mean maybe you’ll come across it more in the record, maybe not but, we’re very much in our own little bubble not really worrying about what other singer-songwriters are around”.

Coming back around once more to the recording process the band are elated at having a break from the studio. Remi, in particular enjoys the twist and turns of playing live, “I grew up listening to and playing jazz music, so I don’t think I’ve ever played the same thing twice. Your mood is definitely going to define how you’re going to play that night, or what you’re going to create, or where it’s going to take you. Especially for jazz, but also for any kind of interesting music”.

Describing their previous recording experiences as ‘claustrophobic and intense’,

Eleanor explains, “It consisted of basically being trapped in flat for weeks on end, but I think when it’s not quite as crazy and confined it can be really great, it’s almost like a blank canvas, you can just start and chuck ideas at something and the whole creativity of it is amazing”.

She adds, “I think we’re massive perfectionists, to the extent of where sometimes it’s a bit ridiculous. There’s times where we don’t agree on stuff, but with the album I don’t think we really have time. It’s our initial thoughts going out there, which will be terrifying but interesting. Because otherwise knowing us it would be five years from now, we’d still be tweaking something”.

Igor shakes his head, “Nah” as Eleanor scowls at him disbelieving , “We would. OK, maybe not 5 years, but…trails off”. Igor laughs, “That’s for the second record!”

I leave with an image of them still trapped in the flat, surrounded by recording equipment, constantly tweaking and reshaping their sound, only its five years later and they look like bedraggled castaways on a deserted island. Finally reconciling themselves to the past it seems Daughter are ready to move on.
