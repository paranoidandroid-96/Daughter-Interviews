**What inspired your latest EP?** \
Elena: I suppose the idea of Youth is a very strong theme. I think I personally have a hard time dealing with the idea of growing up. The songs are mainly about being young and fearing death... And lost love... and hatred... All the happy themes! \
Igor: We were very keen to expand our sound for this EP. We had all these ideas that weren't really possible to explore in His Young Heart as we recorded it in my bedroom with 2 or 3 mics and a vocal booth made out of duvets. So it was great to have the knowledge and experience of producer Ian Grimble to help make our vision possible for The Wild Youth.


**What process do you go through to create your music?** \
Igor: There isn't a particular method. We'll go with whatever way the ideas come to us. Quite often Elena will have a couple of lines and some chord ideas and we start from there. Demoing is very important to us so we'll start doing that early on. \
Elena: For lyrics I'm usually quite reclusive. Alone in a dark room with a guitar. It helps if there's a strong beverage involved too.


**How would you describe your sound?** \
Igor: I don't think musicians are the best at describing the music they create but i like to think our music is a blend between atmosphere, songwriting and rawness. \
Elena: I think it's music you would listen to when you're packing old photographs in boxes, and putting them in the attic.


**What would your dream collaboration be?** \
Elena: I think Igor and I have very broad music tastes, so I think this is an extremely difficult question for us, because we could give a long list! But also it's ever-changing as we keep hearing new and interesting music all the time. Right now, my dream collaboration would be with Sun Glitters. I love how he's made glitchy electronic music so beautifully upsetting with a song like Too Much To Lose as a perfect example of this. 


**Where can we catch you performing next?** \
Igor: We'll be playing Communion's festival, Bushstock, on 2 June. Then, later in the summer, we're visiting Latitude,  Green Man and Bestival. There will also be some shows at European festivals.
