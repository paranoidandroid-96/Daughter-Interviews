The singer with London indie group Daughter today admitted that the thought of standing in front of up to 50,000 people was giving her nightmares ahead of the biggest gig of their career.

The band has enjoyed a meteoric rise since Elena Tonra began singing to “a couple of drunk people” at a Kilburn pub in 2010.

Since then she and co-members Igor Haefeli and Remi Aguilella have released two albums — their second, Not To Disappear, reaching the UK Top 20 in January.

Relentless gigging across the UK and abroad has seen them build up a legion of fans. One of their songs, Youth, has been streamed 72 million times on Spotify and was used in ITV’s 2012 Tour de France advert.

They are now set to perform on their biggest ever stage — in the main arena at this week’s Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona, where Radiohead and LCD Soundsystem will also appear.

Tonra, 26, from Northwood, told said: “I have a recurring anxiety dream, usually to do with being late on stage every time.

“It’s always for something really stupid, such as I’m wandering down a hall and I realise I’ve forgotten to bring something so then I go back and I get lost and then people are looking for me.

“And another time I forgot the words and Igor and Remi had to improvise with a jazz interlude while I tried to remember what was going on.”

She added: “We’ve played Primavera on one of the smaller stages and it was the most overwhelming experience. It’s very exciting to be going back.”

Fans have sent the band an array of unusual gifts, including an album cover made from Lego and chocolates with the musicians’ faces. Tonra said: “Some people even have tattoos of lyrics. It’s surreal.”
