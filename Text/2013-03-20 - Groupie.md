Three Londoners Elena Tonra, Igor Haefeli and Remi Aguilella have been making beautiful, prog-y heartache tunes as Daughter for a couple of years now. They released two EPs last year, His Young Heart and The Wild Youth, and today they put out their debut album If You Leave. And it’s the kind of record you’ll want to play over and over in your bedroom as you contemplate the more cerebral and emotional aspects of life. And when we first heard it, it prompted us to put together an **ode to lost love**.

Just before the release of If You Leave, Groupie caught up with Tonra – and chatted while we were both in our pyjamas, we might add.

**Hello Elena.** \
Hi!

**What’s going on?** \
Nothing, really. It’s evening here, so I’m just chilling at home in my pyjamas.

**Well, I too am in my pyjamas, but it’s quite early in the morning. Are you exhausted from touring?** \
Well, we did a UK tour in January, but actually at the moment we’re just rehearsing because the album is out very soon [today, in fact]. We’ve got a fourth musician that we’re working with at the moment, and we’ll play with him for the live stuff. We’re wanting to recreate the album as well as possible. We made the it and now we’re working out how to play it. When you’re recording it’s nice to be quite free with things and not confine the sound to, like, three instruments.

**And what was that writing and recording process like?** \
For us, the writing process is quite separate. I need to be alone to write the lyrics, so I sit and write in a dark room, and then jam with Igor and then we all work together on arrangements after that. That’s the way that we work best – to give each other some space.

**It’s a really big sound on this record, which I though was interesting. This album was the first music that I’d heard from you guys, but I had read a story that described you as ‘folk’, which, for me, you really aren’t. It’s really more prog-y.** \
Yeah, I think that folk thing stems from me, because I used to do stuff that was just me and a guitar. And our first EP was really stripped down. But not intentionally – we just didn’t have much equipment. The second EP was a little bigger because we worked with a producer in the studio for that one, and then the album is bigger again. We’ve gone a bit pedal happy with this one. Especially Igor. He looks like he has a Christmas tree in front of him every night. And I’m glad you said it’s prog-y. That’s cool.

**How did you guys meet?** \
We met at music college. They had this course in song writing and Igor and I were both doing that and Remi was doing drumming. Igor would come in with a track, rather than a guitar ready to perform, and he just saw things in a different way to me. I thought his work was really cool and really interesting. Igor and I started playing shows just the two of us and then we brought Remi in. I didn’t know Remi too well during the course, but he helped us out on a project when we had to play with a band. He really got it and worked in a really spontaneous way.

**Were you into the same styles of music, or did you arrive at the Daughter sound from different angles?** \
We never had an idea of what Daughter would sound like before we started. We’ve been asked before to describe it, and it really is just the fact that we are all quite different and we listen to different things. And that’s the sound. Igor is interested in atmospherics and electronic elements and Remi has a really interesting way of playing drums, and I’m more focused on lyrics.

**Who are your favourite musicians?** \
Jeff Buckley is one of my big inspirations, particularly from my teen years. I’m drawn to a poetic nature in songwriting. I also really like Thom Yorke. I started listening to Radiohead in my late teens and I find the lyrics very abstract, but also very moving. You don’t know what’s going on, but you’re crying anyway. I love that. And my dad played a lot of Neil Young and Bob Dylan and my mum was really into David Bowie, so since I was a child I’ve been fascinated by good songwriters.

**Bowie’s got a new record out this week, do you think you’ll still be releasing albums when you’ve been in the game as long as he has?** \
I really hope that we will. It’s sometimes good to know when to stop though. For me, I would feel totally annoyed and disappointed with myself if I hadn’t progressed with every new thing that I’d made. And that’s another thing that’s great about Radiohead, they are very progressive and incorporate refreshing elements on each new record. I don’t want to be comfortable and just make things because they worked last time.

**Your lyrics touch on heavy themes. Are they personal or do you create a fictional world for each song?** \
They are basically personal experiences, but it’s really hard to talk about how the writing happens, because I’m not really sure how it does. I don’t really ever sit down and say ‘I’m going to write a song now’. I have to wait for a burst of inspiration. They aren’t detailed diary book entries, they are more about a felling, and more like a warped reality. And others are more observational, but there’s still that element of poetry.

**That’s a nice image, you sitting there and waiting for the muse to come.** \
Yes, it did take me a while to write these songs. And no one really new if we would have an album.

**What was it like to sign with 4AD?** \
Ed from 4AD came to one of our shows in 2011 and really liked it. We started chatting and built a relationship with him. He introduced us to Grimes and that became the soundtrack to our American trip in March, 2012, and we really appreciated his interest in music. And 4AD have really let us make the album that we wanted to make. It’s been really cool. They are just interested in people being creative, and the artists on their roster are really eclectic. The roster is also really awesome, so we did think, ‘oh dear, don’t make anything shit.’

If You Leave is out now.
