PHOTOS & STORY BY OLIVIA SCOTT

The England native band, Daughter, has been no stranger to touring and being on the road these past couple of years. Following the recent release of their newest album, Not fo Disappear, the band has been traveling nonstop across the world playing all kinds of different shows. From festivals to their own headlining shows in various venues around the world—Daughter has done it all.

After finishing up their shows in Europe and the UK in October of 2016, Daughter continued onto the next leg of their world tour in North America. The North American shows set off on November Ist in New York City, New York and ended on December Ist in San Diego, California. During the span of that one month tour, the trio put on over 20 shows throughout the United States.

We were fortunate enough to talk to one of the band members, Elena Tonra (lead vocals, guitar, and bass), about their North American tour and what it had in store for the audience and fans who attended.

When we asked her if she could try and describe the tour in three words she answered with a passionate ‘nostalgic, [an] adventure, and a celebration.” Elena explained that they hoped the tour was going to have a nostalgic aspect to it as they planned to reintroduce some older songs along with the newer ones from *Disappear Here*. The song selection was chosen to appeal to all fans, whether they were old or new, and excite them as much as it had for rest of the band. Elena herself saying, *“It's actually really been so exciting to play again, even in rehearsals... It definitely brings back lots of nice memories of when we were first just starting out”*


Every night, Elena was most excited to play “To Belong”, a newer song that they had not performed during their previous shows. She explained gleefuly, *“[It really excites me], mainly because I get to play bass and I do really like playing bass.”*

Along with the nostalgic feeling of the show, Elena said she also perceived the tour as an adventure. She explained how herself and the band visited and revisited many cities and venues around the United States and that, when possible, the band loved to explore and see what each one had to offer. Elena also mentioned that she was very excited for the crowds in America. When we asked her to compare the crowds here in America to the ones in Europe, she explained that when they play shows in the US, she notices a more vocal response on stage which she believes makes playing the shows all the more enjoyable.

Lastly, she described the tour as a celebration as it lead them to the end of 2016 and marked all the progress and adventures they have had throughout the past year.

As far as the actual show itself, Elena said that her team was aiming to create a more polished show in general with more of a visual experience for the audience. Along with the acoustics and sound quality, the band experimented more with lighting and other stage features to make the shows as enjoyable for the audience as they could.

Fortunately, being able to attend their performance in Philadelphia, we can confirm that their efforts and planning towards the visual portion of their show was a complete success.


## MUSIC

The band utilized the stage to its full potential through the major details of lighting and sound, to the more minute details of the placement of equipment and the band members themselves. All of the members were spread out on stage giving it a very open and visually pleasing appearance. Five long drapes were beautifully hung across the stage behind the three musicians and were used to set the mood of each song as colored lights or patterns were projected brightly on each of them. Additional lighting throughout the show also added to each of the songs as spotlights created patterns against the drapes, lights were either shown harshly or softly across the different band members, or as they flickered to the beat or melody of a song.

The misty air and corresponding soft glow effect from smoke machines created a calm and lighthearted atmosphere throughout the venue and made the room seem smaller than it actually was. Although the venue was quite large and spacious, the concert seemed much more intimate due the efforts of Daughter's crew and the band's acoustics. The power of the band’s music was very prevalent during the show as Elena was able to capture and memorize everyone in the crowd, and the band was able to get people moving, swaying softly to the beat.

Elena's performance was absolutely heartbreaking and haunting in the best way. Her emotions were poured directly into each song and were transported straight into the audience through the lyrics and passion in her voice. Although you could hear the soft singing of the crowd and the occasional conversation, everyone was captivated by the music and was, for the most part, silent. Every instrument could be heard clearly along with Elena's voice throughout the venue. However, this silence was broken at the end of the show with a flood of clapping and shouting in appreciation for the band and their wonderful performance. 

Daughter's show is one I will always remember for many reasons, the most important being the general feeling I got during it. Despite the heavy emotions and lyrics, their performance was one of the most calming I have ever experienced and left me feeling genuinely happy and at peace. It's definitely a show I would love to see again with friends or especially with a significant other. The amount of couples at the show holding each other and swaying to the music was absolutely precious.

Although the bulk of Daughter's touring is now done since completing their multiple headlining tours, I would strongly recommend seeing them or at least listening to their music as soon as possible. The passion the band has for their music as well as the talent each of their members has is incredible and completely worth experiencing live. I cannot wait fo see what they have in store for the future and I hope to see them again soon!
