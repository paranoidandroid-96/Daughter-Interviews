Hello! It has been so many years since I last wrote from here.. they have been full, highs and lows. I imagine so much has been happening in your life too over these past years. I am sending my best wishes to you, to where you are right now.

I am very happy to be writing to you again from our Daughter website. We have a new album coming out this April, it’s called "Stereo Mind Game". It has been in the making for a long time, pieced together delicately (obsessively maybe) over years, trying to make it as complete as it could ever feel. I think it’s more optimistic than our past records (but it still has my lyrics.. so.. it’s never going to be full sunshine) but I've tried to document experiences, thoughts, feelings, conversations and memories from my life, and hope that we've turned them into something listenable, something positive. I'm hopeful further that the lyrics might connect or feel familiar, and that this is in some way helpful or can bring a few minutes of joy or comfort. That would be wonderful.

If you were hoping for a new song today, i’m afraid you might be disappointed. I’m sorry. The first song from our album will be coming out on Monday (9th January). It is called Be On Your Way and it is a story of love (of course), and of time, distance, missing and letting go. I have been trying to learn across the past few years to value the present moment more. I used to mourn the goodbye of a relationship before it had ended, and that created an overwhelming feeling of fear around loving someone. So i’m trying to be more accepting that things will last for the time they last for. To fully appreciate all the beautiful connections as they enter, and leave, my life.

I really appreciate YOU, dear reader, dear listener, for allowing me to continue to make music. The child who would hide pages and pages of poems in a drawer and the teenage me writing songs to make sense of my feelings, both thank you so very much. To think I am here now in my thirties, still writing and recording music, 10 years as a band with Igor and Remi, it is honestly a dream come true. You have allowed us to do that with all of your support and your kind words of encouragement. We truly cannot thank you enough.

We are so happy with our new song, with our new album, and so excited to share with you! (For a while it seemed to swallow us up, never sure if it would ever be finished, but we are so proud that it is!) Thank you for your patience.

I really hope you enjoy the new song on Monday, and the new video too! So much love sent to you, and wishing you a beautiful evening or day, dreams or daydreams, Elena x
