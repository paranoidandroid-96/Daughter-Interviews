Boston Calling Music Festival was filled with many talented artists. There was something for all ages and I am thankful that I was given the opportunity to be there! During my time at this awesome three day festival, I was given the chance to go backstage and interview a band that I’ve been a fan of for a long time. “Daughter” is an Indie-Folk band from North London, that’s making heads turn and ears listen. With an ambient vibe and lyrics that will touch your soul, Daughter is becoming a force to be reckoned with.

Going backstage was an awesome experience! I met with Daughter band members, Elena Tonra and Igor Haefeli and as we walked into their dressing room, we all got comfortable and took the opportunity to get right down to the questions. I hope that all of you  can hopefully take something away from the advice and insight Elena and Igor so graciously gave me! Enjoy!

**Hil: It’s really nice to meet both of you, I’ve been excited about this for a while! So my first question is, how did you all meet and start making music? When did you realize that this could be something pretty big?**

**Elena:** Well we all went to the same music school!

**Igor:** It’s called the Institute of Contemporary Music and Performance so the abbreviation is ICMP and yeah, there was a songwriting course that had just started there. I joined it and met Elena who was there to do the same thing I was. We were studying songwriting and Remi was studying drumming. When college finished we started playing together. We started from there and we had some old material that we started playing with. Elena played her acoustic guitar and singed, and I came in on electric guitar and added to it. We started playing in my bedroom, Remi joined and then the first EP happened.

**Elena:** This all really happened by chance actually, and we would have never met if we hadn’t gone to that school. It was a one year course and I came into it because a friend of mine was doing the same course. Yeah, it was very much like that, really weird chance meetings. I just wonder what would have happened if we wouldn’t have been in the same place at the same time!

**Hil: Was the school you went to your first choice? What did you learn from going there?**

**Elena:** When I think back to our time at school, the course we were in was a very new course and it was the first time we’d ever done a songwriting class. That kind of thing isn’t very common and I didn’t really know of any other schools that were doing it.

**Igor:** I think the reason why we went to that school is because it was the first that we’ve heard of to do so in London…

**Elena:** The classes there were good if you really tried to get everything you could out of them. I remember sitting in Music Theory and having absolutely no idea about anything that was going on. Like, I can’t read and write music and I remember thinking “Ooh, this is tense!” So I was trying to feel my way around and it was difficult for me. The concept of reading and writing music was so difficult and my brain couldn’t wrap itself around it! Then there were other classes like my music and production class. I had always written on instruments, so for them to open that world of filtering music from your computer and using programs like Logic I learned, even though I wasn’t very good at it, how you can make any sound you want with these programs! There were a lot of little things that completely benefited how I write now and I think that if I wouldn’t have gone I probably wouldn’t write the same. Who you are as a writer and how you feel, I don’t necessarily think you can teach someone how to write a song as a subject. It’s more about the craft and the skills and how to use different things, but to write, it’s just more of a natural, vomit kind of a thing (laughs).

**Igor:** It’s such a tough thing to formalize such a personal form of expression. The Institute definitely tried to nurture everyone’s artistic aspirations in terms of what they were about and what they wanted to do. It was our first year and we were a bit all over the place but it was really amazing. What was very special was that it was the first time it was appearing in London that all the people who had been waiting for that class showed up! It was a very motivating class! It was a very inspiring to be around all these people who really wanted to do better, and learn more.

**Elena:** It was a really different style. When I saw Igor in the class, I knew I wanted to work with him because I didn’t know anyone else who was making music like him. His brain, to me was very weird. He has a very interesting way of doing things and is just plain weird, which is what I really liked about his writing style.  Some people would come in with guitars or with their keyboard, but Igor would come in with these full odd tracks that he’d made at home and I just thought “Wow this guy is really cool, I like his brain.” It was inspiring to be surrounded by lots of different people with different ways of expressing themselves.

**Hil:** Sounds very familiar, very much like Berklee!

**Hil: Who or what inspires you when you’re writing?**

**Igor:** So many things! Most things, in some way. To me it’s very unconscious. It’s not something that I necessarily  think about or purposefully, like this and this is  inspiring me. I find that I kind of chase a feeling or some sort of impression, something that evokes me. So when i’m making music, if I see an image or feel something strongly, I feel like i’m going to get somewhere with it.

**Elena:** I was thinking about this the other day! I think that from a lyrical perspective, when I look at what I’ve written, it’s almost written in like a trance-like state. I don’t really think about it, and when I flip back I end up realizing like “Wow, I’ve really pulled from something someone said to me one day, or something I saw on a wall another day.” I kind of like grabbing and stuffing everything in and all at once, it’ll fall into place. Lyrically, it’s more people and memories that are inspiring but musically, it comes from touring and performing at festivals and hearing other bands. I definitely pick up other sounds and styles and that’s really inspiring to me.

**Hil: What is your writing process like?**

**Elena:** I think for the new album, it didn’t really happen in a normal way of writing. Sometimes Igor would come up with a musical idea and then we’d work with it and do it that way. Sometimes there would be songs that would be just guitar and vocals and we’d work backwards from there. It never really happens the same way each time which is a lot of fun.

**Igor:** I think the most prominent way of doing it for us would be, often  Elena would come up with an idea and have a demo or a few chords and generally the lyrics would work out and we’d start to build from it. Sometimes we start with the music…

**Elena:** Sometimes we wouldn’t even be in the same room!

**Igor:** It’s usually a lot of fun, especially with the new album, a lot of the songs up until the end were kind of mutating. We had the core of the songs but there were still things changing and sections being added in the studio.

**Hil: Has your sound changed since you’ve been together?**

**Igor:** Yes, definitely! I’d like to think that we have kept a similar sensibility throughout our music. We are still moved by the same things and are inspired by similar things but I think that we have really tried to broaden our horizons and bring that to our own music as well. The music we listen to has changed and we also all listen to very different things. We are always pushing what we have done and trying to get out of our comfort zone. From our first EP, which was recorded in our bedroom with an acoustic guitar, electric guitar, a couple of drums and a few mics to going to spending two months in a proper studio, there’s a different feeling and experience!

**Hil: What is your favorite song out of all the music you’ve written together?**

**Igor:** I mean we’re really bad at favorites in general. There’s plenty. They all happened in such different ways. I think that each time a song is done and we both like it and decide to put it on the record, I think that’s an achievement and each new one becomes the new favorite for a while. It’s a lot like that.

**Hil: They’re each your baby. It’s like having to pick your favorite child!**

**Igor:** Its like, “I like that one, and that one too, and why isn’t that one going on the record!?”

**Hil: What has been the most surprising or most difficult part about the music industry? Was there ever a time where you wanted to give up and what made you want to keep going?**

**Igor:** We have been really lucky because in a way we’ve done everything really purposefully. We carefully chose who we wanted to work with in different areas of the industry from booking, to labels, to lawyers etc. and so we were really, really lucky. Most people are at no point telling us what to do creatively which is really nice because that’s one thing we’ve been able to deal with pretty well. That’s a big thing, not being pushed about and that’s something I think people should be really careful of. You do get to choose, but it just means that maybe you’re gonna get less instantaneous money or something like that. I think that ultimately in the long run, it’s a lot more beneficial than getting short term gain or a big advance etc. Just make sure that you negotiate for it to be creatively positive for you, because ultimately, that’s why you’re doing it, hopefully.

**Elena:** I think we have been especially lucky actually, and I think I get pissed off at the music industry on other peoples behalf. There has been just early stuff, even before Igor, Remi and I met each other. I went for this meeting ages ago when I was a kid, and they told me that in order to succeed, I’d have to change my image. I was like “F-ck off”. And I think that’s what spurs me on, is that side – the dark side of the music industry, where you have to be something that people want to sell. Where you need to dress a certain way, and be a certain way. It just like, I don’t want any part of that, so I think maybe that’s why we we’re so careful. There are certainly things about the industry side that I just don’t like and ultimately, we are not in it for that side. We are the creative side so I think that the industry just has bad stuff you need to do everything you can to avoid.

**Hil: If you could play with anyone, dead or alive, who would it be with and why?**

**Elena:** Ooooh! Jeff Buckley because he’s amazing (laughs)! Mainly just because he was my childhood, kind of “who I wanted to be”, and I still want to be Jeff Buckley to be fair!

**Igor:** Oh, there are so, so many people! As for right now, I think Avro Pärt the classical composer, that’d be great!

**Elena:** He just seems like the loveliest most beautiful person as well!

**Hil: What tip would you give to those musicians trying to make it in the music industry?**

**Igor:** If you’re in a position where you have met people who are willing to work with you, make sure that they are the right people and that they are in it for the right reasons. Don’t be attracted by short term gain and just think before you do anything.

**Elena:** From our point of view, I guess when we were starting, we played a lot and I think that that was really important for us. To just make sure that we kept becoming a better and better band! Even with playing live, practice writing and getting to know each other really well. So, just play lots of shows, that’s what I would say! And have fun!

**Hil:** Great! Thank you so much for talking with me, I really appreciate it!

**Elena:** Of course, thank you!

**Igor:** Thank you, thanks for coming out!

Elena and Igor were truly some of the kindest, most humble people I’ve met and they were a joy to interview.  I really enjoyed getting to hear what they had to say about their writing process, their experiences together as a band, and their overall views about the music industry! I hope that you get a sense of all the valuable points they made as much as I did. I have no doubt that Daughter will go far with their music, because they have worked hard to get to where they are and they definitely deserve it!

**Thank you Daughter and Glassnote Records for setting this up with me and for making this experience a truly memorable one!**
