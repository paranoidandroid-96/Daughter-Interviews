# Daughter’s Remi Aguilella On Their New Album, Collabs And Hotline Bling
December 17, 2015



By HUGO ROBINSON.

Before I could stutter some awkward remark about the weather, keeping in mind this interview was over the phone with a person in Tokyo, Remi Aguilella asked me, “How are you doing man?”

As a matter of fact, I had an exam that afternoon, so I was nervous and half submerged in sweat. Listening over the interview again confirmed that I was sincerely gurgling in my own anxiety.

Aguilella, the French-born drummer of UK dream-pop band Daughter, met the other two-thirds of the band while studying percussion. He has rarely featured in interviews with Daughter before, so getting this time to talk to him was interesting, informative and felt quite candid too.

While also telling me about the weird Christmas presents he has been stocking up on, he shed some light on the choice of percussion for the band, and his influences.

“I didn’t want to put too many cymbals at first… because with Elena playing the guitar and singing, and Igor playing the guitar as well, you want to make sure that those are high frequencies and if you want to complete the whole spectrum… it felt more appropriate to do something along the lines of more toms and more tribal.”

Daughter’s new album, Not to Disappear, is coming out next year on January 15th. Aguilella talked about the difference in producing and recording this album compared to their 2013 record, If You Leave, which saw them record over a period of about six months while touring.

“Whenever we could find a studio in London, obviously within our budget, we just had to kind of go there and do a few weeks of recording. But then, there was always the idea of, like, ‘Oh well, we’re going to have to pack all of our instruments and go to another place after.’”

This time around, they sought out Nicolas Verhnes, who has produced for the likes of Deerhunter, and spent two and a half months recording at his studio in New York.

“You know that the equipment is going to be the same every day, you know that the microphones are going to be placed the same way,” said Aguilella.

We can hear in the singles, Numbers and Doing the Right Thing, from the new album, that the sound is more cavernous, the production more electronic, and the voice of Elena Tonra more upfront, grittier and less fragile than before. They’re all very happy with the results.

“I think [the album] came pretty naturally. We’ve been touring for a couple of years and this is… a little bit more intense in a way that it is summing up the touring that we did on If You Leave… Hopefully people like it, we’ll see,” said Aguilella.

The conversation then turned to some more personal material again. It happened that Daughter was doing promo not a week before the Paris attacks, and were staying right next to where it occurred. Remi also has a brother in Brussels, so there was another scary moment, but fortunately everyone was okay.

Following on a lighter note, we touched on his personal listening which, he pointed out, was limited during recording of the album, because the last thing you really want after ten hours in the studio is to go home and listen to more music.

It is safe to say however, that Mr Aguilella’s tastes now that he has free time have passed the test; listing Kurt Vile, The War on Drugs, Tame Impala, Sylvan Esso and good ol’ Father John Misty as some of his favourites. I noted that it seems we often get drawn to artists making music in the same vein to us. He agreed, but then went on to say, “It is also good to, eventually, try something different… I would be lying if I said I didn’t listen to Hotline Bling by Drake. I think I listened to it about a thousand times.”

Speaking on the topic of their recent tour with Ben Howard, a close friend of the band, we got on to collaborations and his most memorable show. It was their performance while supporting Ben Howard at Red Rocks that stuck out for Aguilella.

I also asked who he and the band would most like to collaborate with.

“I’m not too sure, actually”, he said. “We did one with Warpaint… where they remixed one of our songs and then we did a remix of one of their songs and that was pretty fun, so it could be along those lines. Or, we did a collaboration a couple of years ago with a conductor called Joe Duddell. He made a ten-piece orchestra arrangement and we ended up playing them for a session. It was a very different energy on stage.”

I will add, these are a must listen. If you just give ‘Daughter Joe Duddell’ a search on YouTube, you won’t be disappointed. Aguilella mentioned their Daft Punk cover for the Live Lounge too. So, naturally, I suggested that a cover of Hotline Bling was in order. I am 90% sure this will come to fruition as Remi seemed mildly enthused about it.

Mildly.
