Daughter's debut album has been described as "staggeringly beautiful", "heart-rending" and "infinitely bleak" by critics. Singled out as ones-to-watch by the BBC in 2011, the London trio return the favour by headlining the BBC Introducing stage this year. Singer Elena Tonra says she's "very excited".

**Your lyrics - "we're setting fire to our insides for fun" - are pretty dark. How does that go down in the middle of the afternoon?**

It's funny because you'd think it'd be a bit of a downer - but this weekend in Sweden, everyone was singing and clapping along. Obviously, it's not a massive party vibe but I think, maybe the way we play live, it's slightly more upfront than the recordings.

**So no-one ever cries?**

Sometimes people do cry, but that doesn't mean they're not enjoying themselves. I went to see Sigur Ros in Berlin last year and I cried from start to finish, but I had the best time. I'm a crier. It's ok.

**As you're playing inside a tent, you won't be bothered if it rains.**

I hadn't thought about that! If you're playing an outside stage and it's pelting down with rain, you must be quite worried. But on covered stages, you get people who are trying to take shelter and had never planned to listen to you.

**You recently covered Daft Punk's Get Lucky for Radio 1's Live Lounge. Will that be part of your Glastonbury set?**

We'll have to see. It came out a couple of times on the US tour, but we don't play it that often. If we were going to play it, the BBC Introducing stage would be the place to bring it out.

Daughter play the John Peel tent at 1700 BST and the BBC Introducing stage at 2025 BST on Saturday.
