Nearly three years after the release of their debut If You Leave, Daughter – the London-based trio of Elena Tonra, Igor Haefeli and Remi Aguilella – will return in 2016 with a new album, entitled Not To Disappear.  Their first single, ‘Doing The Right Thing’, can be heard online today.

Eager for a fresh approach to music videos, Daughter invited filmmakers Iain Forsyth & Jane Pollard (directors of the Nick Cave film 20,000 Days on Earth) to create three films for Not To Disappear.  Author Stuart Evers was commissioned to write three short stories – ‘Dress’, ‘Window’ and ‘5,040’ – based on select Not To Disappear tracks.  Iain & Jane’s videos are interpretations of those tales.  ‘Doing The Right Thing’ (based on the story ‘Dress’) is the first of the visual trilogy.

‘Doing The Right Thing’ concerns the delicate subject of dementia and its debilitating, all-pervading effect on family.  Jane & Iain’s video of ‘Doing The Right Thing’ is a sympathetic portrayal.  You can watch the video via the band's YouTube channel here, or in the player below.  You can stream the track via Spotify here.

Not To Disappear is Daughter’s second album and finds the band making confident strides forward both sonically and lyrically.  Elena, Igor and Remi spent a summer in New York recording Not To Disappear with Nicolas Vernhes (Deerhunter, War On Drugs, Animal Collective) at his Rare Book Room studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. 

Not To Disappear will be released digitally and on CD and LP on 15th January 2016.
You can pre-order on iTunes (w/ instant download of 'Doing The Right Thing') here.
