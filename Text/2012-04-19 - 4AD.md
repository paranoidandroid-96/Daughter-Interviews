The London-based trio of Elena Tonra, Igor Haefeli and Remi Aguilella, collectively known as Daughter, has signed to 4AD worldwide, outside of North America.

On the strength of just two EPs, His Young Heart and The Wild Youth, Daughter have built for themselves a dedicated following, illustrated by their sold-out show at the 700-capacity Assembly Hall in North London. No mean feat for a band whose current incarnation has been performing together for a mere eighteen months.

Commenting on their new career path, Daughter say, “We couldn’t be happier to be working with 4AD, a label that has released so many inspirational records and whose ethos we hold in very high regard. It really is a privilege.”

Daughter are working on their debut album. In the mean time, the trio will be playing the following shows. You can also watch an acoustic performance of 'Medicine' below, a track taken from The Wild Youth EP.
