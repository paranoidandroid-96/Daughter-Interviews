You think you don’t know Daughter, but you’ve probably already heard them.The ambient alt-folk triohas provided the broodingly bleak soundtrack for many-a-TV drama ( “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Skins,” “The Originals”), and will drop their sophomore album, “Not To Disappear,” on Friday. The London-based trio will then embark on a North American tour this spring to support the release this spring — with stops in Somerville and Philadelphia.
We caught up with 26-year-oldlead singer Elena Tonraduring a break from rehearsal with her bandmates Igor Haefeli and Remi Aguilella.

**How does the art on the cover of “Not to Disappear” tie into the theme of the album?**

It’s a painting by Sara Shore, an artist from Brighton [in the UK]. Igor was looking through an art catalog, came across her work and loved it. It was just so peaceful and really fit with how the album sounds.

**What do you think drives the themes in your music? I hear plenty of bleakness, but some underlying hope, too.**

I think so. I hopefully think there always is, in everything that we make, that we’re hopeful — that there is peace in it, as well as being kind of sad. To have the music take it up there [to hopefulness] is a credit to the guys more than me.

**So you bring the darkness and they bring the hope?**

Maybe.

**The subject of “Numbers” is clearly going through a painful breakup, but still refers to their loneliness as a “kingdom.” Do you feel like there is a redeeming quality to loneliness?**

I find it quite inspiring sometimes. Whenever I am in that mind frame, I find it makes me write, probably because I’m not very inspired to write when I’m feeling okay [Laughs]. There is something about loneliness that inspired me to write a lot of songs on the album. It’s a strange thing.

**Was there a particular loss that inspired this album?**

There’s a song about my grandmother, which I had never written about before, I think that kind of came out of nowhere. My brain had wanted to talk about it for a while, and I hadn’t really. Just the loss of memory and of self — she’s still alive, but it’s a loss of her soul. I mean, she’s still there, but it’s hard when you see someone your whole life and maybe they don’t know exactly who you are anymore.

**Do you feel like we’re seeing a broader shift toward more vulnerability in music and culture more generally?**

I haven’t really noticed it too much. There have been were a lot of times where I’d go to second guess where I’m writing, and then I just say “Well, write what you want to write.” I think honesty is the best policy. I don’t know if it’s a trend; I think I’ve always just loved records that feel really honest, like they’re not filtered or overthought.

We haven’t really been listening to records a lot when making an album. We tend to go on a dry spell and shut ourselves away. But I absolutely loved “Carrie & Lowell” [by Sufjan Stevens]. That to me was such an honest record and it was just so beautiful, one of the most beautiful things I’ve heard for a long time.
