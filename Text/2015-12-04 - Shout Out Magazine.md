While Daughter was in Tokyo, we manage to do a fun, exclusive interview with lead vocalist, Elena from Daughter via phone to find out what has 2015 thrown at the band and what is to come in 2016.

**Q: So what have you guys done in Japan?**

**Elena:** We just played a show two days ago, now we have four days off which is a luxury we never have and then we are off to Singapore on Friday 27th November…

**Q: How has the recent year been so far?**

**Elena:** Well we just had some shows in the UK, we road tested some of our new songs from the upcoming album which was terrifying but also great (haha). But yeah we have just been playing a few shows whilst incorporating the new stuff in there, then its a proper rehearsal for the new album for the shows next year. I say that hopefully (haha)…

**Q: I see that you opened for Ben Howard in the USA and Europe this year, how was that?**

**Elena:** Oh he’s amazing, yeah! Really great, he was actually one of the first people we ever toured with, when it was just me and Igor. So it was really early times of the band and he (Ben) took us in his van and we went around Europe, you know it was really lovely and the fact that he introduced us to his fans was really great because they were a very supportive audience and he really supported our music. So being on this tour with him was very nostalgic and remembering the early days of both Ben and us…. but now it’s 5-6 of them on stage and it’s like amazing, all of them, and they sound awesome and he’s amazing to watch live. And to see him evolve from his first record to now has been quite inspirational… and his soundscapes and him live now is just so amazing.

**Q: So we’re expecting a new album from you guys in 2016, how has the process been? What has been the key inspiration behind this album? What will this album bring about?**

**Elena:** To be honest, I’m still telling everyone all of my secrets, it’s just like why am I doing this? Haha… no I feel it’s just a personal and confessional record in many ways. What’s really exciting for us is that we’re experimenting new sounds even in the way we were writing together, which really left all the options open and you know, we really didn’t want to limit what our band was capable of doing, genre-wise like “Oh we can’t really use synths here or electronics”.

But we were like “Nah, let’s do whatever we want”, like a blank canvas. And I hope that when our fans and everyone hears it they pick up on that. Even comparing to our first album, this upcoming album will include more spontaneous collaborative ideas we all put on it which is great. I think it’s hard to explain it, I think we’re just like “Ooh that’s our album” and we can’t see it defined in a categorised way. I think it’s more of an ambitious, maybe a bit more of a confident record compared to the first one. Igor said that there’s less reverb for him, which for our co-producer, Nicholas was like “Turn the reverb down”, making sure people actually hear what we’re saying and not hiding behind a lot of reverb. It’s hard because reverb is a total comfort blanket for me because it’s like “OMG”, you can actually hear the vocals now, but I think that’s the confidence side showing. You know? Like showing the honesty in our lyrics and challenging what we can actually do.

**Q: So how did you chose ” Doing The Right Things” as your first single?**

**Elena:** Well it’s six minutes long and it’s not a song that really screams “Single” because it’s kinda depressing but it was just one of our favourites. It shifted quite a lot when we were demo-ing it and we were recording it for 2 months over in NYC whilst recording the rest of the album after writing it back in London. I was just very protective over that song because the way it came about, it was first put to guitar. The subject matter is especially inspired by my grandmother, and so I don’t know why I became protective over it. I was always like “No, don’t destroy the heart of the song with like too much stuff” and I’d almost put it in a box and let no one touch it. But I finally let my guards down and let other people put in their creative ideas and then the song actually sounded better in the end. And it’s different cause it’s from someone else’s perspective and not mine.

**Q: You’re guys music is so heavily featured in TV Shows (and movies), how do you find that? Is there a show or a movie you’d be like “Wow, yeah you can feature our songs anytime”…**

**Elena:** Yeah like any Coen Brothers film, haha, would be so great. I don’t know, like the feeling of seeing our music put to visuals is an exciting thing. And sometimes it’s put to scenes that don’t suit what the song is generally about but it still works. It’s cool how Music Supervisors interpret the song and how they place it in the show or movie. We’re inspired by film so I just feel anything murdery drama would be awesome for our songs to feature in. The cool thing about it is that when people watch shows they’d wondered what that song was and then search it and then people will be like “I became a fan of you guys because of my favourite show” and they would never find it through if it wasn’t for that film or whatever.

**You guys have been here for Laneway, will you guys be coming over anytime soon to New Zealand? Any memories from Laneway?**

**Elena:** Aww! We’d love to, it’d be so great. We had so much on the Laneway tour, so amazing and had such a lovely time so as soon as possible would be great haha! I hope so. The amazing thing with Laneway is that you travel with the same bands which is so rare. So to see this people performing was great and you get to know them as well throughout. We went to Waiheke Island actually on our day off and we went to this vineyard and there was like the BEST GRASS EVER! And then everyone was like “Have you felt this grass”, so we took off our shoes off and we were like “OMG!” and it was like the strangest thing, a group of people feeling their grass haha…

**A lot of stars (Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber) have come over to film music videos, will you guys be keen to film a video here?**

**Elena:** Oh yes that would be amazing, yeah we could have a weird beachy video to one of our songs which are really sad, and the video could be very happy, just having people enjoying the beach while Igor, Remi and I just stand in the middle there like really grumpy haha! It’d be funny but maybe yeah, let’s direct this! We got video gold!

**Any last things you’d like to say to your Kiwi fans?**

**Elena:** Oh! Just a huge thank you for listening to our stuff and we are so overwhelm at how far our music transcends to and the responses we get. We never knew how much people would listen to our first album, it was way more than what we expected and to who comes to our shows, so just a big thank you!

Moreover you can listen to the full interview where I asked how did the band feel about the recent Paris attacks…
