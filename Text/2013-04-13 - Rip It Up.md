What a life! When Rip It Up catches up with **Daughter’s** Elena Tonra, the songwriter and vocalist is just hanging out in Istanbul like it’s no big deal. Amid exploring the streets and prepping for their show in the Turkish city in the evening, Tonra takes some time for a muffled chat down the phone about her London band’s rise.

With the recent release of their stunning and exposed debut If You Leave, Daughter are right in the middle of busy times.

“It's a relief that it’s out now ‘cause we’ve worked on it for a long time,” Tonra admits.

“It’s definitely a personal record, so it's a bit daunting sometimes that people are exposed to my random thoughts,” she giggles, “just telling everyone everything.”

Personal is an understatement, given If You Leave exposes Elena’s innermost thoughts. Every track follows a new path of exploration into the deepest depths of the 23-year-old’s delicate emotions. With such a personal record now floating around the globe, Tonra finds it hard not to take reviews personally.

“I really have tried [not to read reviews] but there’s always the fascination. I have been slightly naughty and gone against my word, and have looked at a few, but then I’ve had to be like ‘Noooo!’,” she proclaims. “I deleted Twitter and all these things off my phone, ‘cause I know that I will do it. You can start judging yourself based on what other people have said about you. I’m not overly confident and I think if I read to many negative things I think I would curl up and never leave the house!

“You make an album for a year and it is quite emotionally draining and then after a week [of it being released] people are just tearing it apart and you’re like, ‘Aww for fuck’s sake!’,” she continues with a laugh. “It’s just better not to read anything ‘cause it’s really destroying, especially for your creativity.”

What began as one-woman band quickly expanded, all stemming from Tonra’s dislike of performing live.

“Performing solo was… well, I didn’t really enjoy it. I found it quite difficult, it just wasn’t very exciting. I wanted to work with other people because I had a bigger sound in my head that was not achievable with just the one guitar.

“I can’t say I’m the best guitarist either,” she laughs, “and that's very limiting I think.”

Tonra found her ‘other people’ to work with while studying.

“I met Igor [Haefeli] and Remi [Aguilella] in college, but Igor first. What was great about him was that he was very much into production and into tracks. It was just very interesting the way his mind worked. He’s got some really cool ideas and I just think we work really well together.”

All that was missing was a bit of drum action. It appears that like-minded souls apparently really do attract.

“Ah Remi, bless him,” Tonra reflects fondly. “In college everyone got assigned to a band, and he was the drummer for everyone in the class. So I had to do this task and I have no ability to write music, I don’t understand it. So everybody had to write scores and I just didn’t really do it. The performance day came around and I was like, ‘Ahhh shit’, so I just went, ‘Right, guys - kind of wing it’ and it was great actually. Remi was amazing, he played this beat that completely suited the song, we still use it now. So from that moment on I was like, well, we need to be with someone who doesn’t mind coming up with stuff at last minute and I like that in a person.”

Bam. You’ve got yourself a band.

Mid conversation this sweet little cupcake pauses to apologise: “I have a tendency to talk a lot of rubbish for a long time!”. Then Tonra is straight back on the talk train, delving into the likelihood of these charming Brits sailing the high seas to come and visit Australia.

“Well,” she hesitates, “there’s nothing confirmed but we are really trying and we really want to. I would absolutely love it. Even if I have to come over by myself and stay in someone’s living room I will do it! So hopefully, but there’s nothing confirmed as of yet. It’s a strong maybe.”

I smell a plane ticket in the air, don’t you?

Tonra has a few ideas for some smaller, more exotic gigs.

“Playing in a cave would be really cool,” she chuckles. “I don’t know many caves, so I haven’t picked one. I don’t know if there would be some kind of risk with that. You probably wouldn’t be able to play too loud. What if it caved in and everyone was trapped? It would be the shittest gig ever!”
