When it came time for British three-piece Daughter to make videos for their new album, “Not to Disappear,” they sent three songs to writer Stuart Evers (“Ten Stories About Smoking”). Evers then wrote three short stories, which were then used as the basis for the videos “Doing the Right Thing,” “Numbers” and now “How,” which premieres on Speakeasy today.

The story that inspired the video for “How” is called “5,040,” which refers to the number of ways the woman in the video can lock her door. One day, she decides to get the courage up and go out into the world, where an eerie scene takes place on a beach.

“I love the fact that it wasn’t necessarily about the song,” says Daughter guitarist/vocalist Elena Tonra. “There’s a surreal army of women in red dresses that turn toward her. It feels quite nightmarish.”

For all three videos, Daughter tapped filmmakers Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (Nick Cave’s “20,000 Days on Earth”) to create the visuals, with the common thread being a red dress seen in each clip. In “How,” it’s a symbol “up for interpretation.”

“There’s a lot of texture that we use,” Tonra says of the band’s music. “We all love film and we’re very excited about the idea that people would want to use our music to put for visuals.”

Daughter is gearing up for a North American tour in support of “Not to Disappear,” starting on Mar. 3 in Philadelphia.

“Not to Disappear” is out now on Glassnote Records. Watch the videos for “Doing the Right Thing” and “Numbers” below:
