Not To Disappear, the studio album by Daughter turns 10 this year. To celebrate reaching the milestone, the trio of Elena Tonra, Igor Haefeli and Remi Aguilella share a brand new song, ‘Not Enough’.

Originally written and demo’ed during sessions for Not To Disappear, ‘Not Enough’ was recorded at London’s Total Refreshment studio in November 2025. The track was produced by Igor Haefeli and mixed by Nicolas Vernhes.

“’Not Enough’ didn't find its place on Not To Disappear but we always loved it - we even played it live a few times before it went back to being a demo buried on a hard-drive. To mark the album’s 10th anniversary, we wanted to revisit some of the unfinished threads from that era. In November 2025 we finally all found ourselves in London again and recorded ’Not Enough’ in the studio together. We live in different places now, and some of our recent work has happened remotely, so this felt like old times.”
