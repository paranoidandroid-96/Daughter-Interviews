**Hey Elena! You're currently on the other side of the Atlantic working on a new album, how's it going?** \
It's going well, I think we're all excited about how things are sounding. We've nearly finished tracking. We're headed back home to London in a couple of weeks time. We will be pretty sad to leave this neighbourhood behind.

**What drew you guys to the other side of the pond?** \
We're over here working with Nicolas Vernhes in his studio in Greenpoint. He's super wonderful, and the studio is a treasure trove! We had spent a long time in London writing and demoing the new songs; we initially rented a room at Cable Street Studios and put everything we had gear-wise and all our instruments into that room so that we could write and record whatever we wanted at whatever time of day or night - which was really great, but it's actually been really refreshing for us to go into the master recordings in a completely new city.

**After the success of 'If You Leave, how were you feeling going into the writing and recording of its follow-up?** \
Surprisingly, I think we were feeling pretty free going into the new album! From our first EPs into 'If You Leave' and now from that into the new record, we've always tried to see the next thing we're working on as a blank canvas. I think we tried to forget about the first album as much as possible. Obviously it's hard to do that, but going into something as a completely new body of work without restricting yourself by thinking, "Is this too different or not different enough?" is the kind of over thinking that gets in the way of feeling complete freedom creatively. There are definitely similarities, but we really felt good going into this record, that we could make whatever we wanted to, and I think we really are.

**What sort of ground are you finding yourselves covering?** \
There has been a stronger sense of capturing our first instincts, a lot of the lyrics were written as they were being recorded and we recorded a lot of our jams together at Cable Street. I would just sing whatever came into my head, and because we had all our recording equipment up and running we could listen back to everything after. It was good to be able to get those instinctive thoughts documented - and they have pretty much all been used. I also think both musically and lyrically we are being more direct in our writing and sound, there's not a lot of hiding places in the new songs.

**What else have you got coming up?** \
Album making / finishing / mixing, rehearsing and the dates supporting Ben Howard. Then hopefully we'll play a few of our own shows.
