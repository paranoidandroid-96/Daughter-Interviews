# Daughter
## Originating with the eloquent Elena Tonra, the three-piece Daughter have emerged from nowhere to countrywide plaudits. Charlotte Gay went back stage with the trio before their Bournemouth gig

The line for Daughter snakes around the front of The Old Fire Station, one of the early signs that their popularity has exploded in recent months. Catching up on the last night of their UK tour before they start the festival season, Daughter certainly haven’t been riding on the coattails of anybody to become as notable as they have. 

Their music is atmospheric, haunting, but also quite melancholic. Elena’s song-writing is rooted in torment and the music is deeply intimate. Lyrics like Smother’s ‘I sometimes wish I’d stayed inside my mother’ or Landfill’s ‘don’t think about the consequences, throw me in the dirt pit’, it’s clear they’re written from a troubled place. Could this just be teenage angst, or did it ever concern her families or friends when first listening?

"I think it was pretty clear to my parents. I didn’t really play the songs to many people at the beginning," confessed Elena. "The first ones I ever wrote weren’t really songs, they were more poems and it was really hidden in a drawer. No one knew about it, no one saw it, no one read it or anything. I then combined that writing with playing guitar, and went out and did some shows, but it was very sporadic because my friends would push me on stage."

In revealing her shrinking violet personality, Elena started as "never one that wanted to perform or anything". She adds: "I think I’m still pretty introverted in that sense, so I am still kind of learning how to do that".

However, since the solo artist became part of a trio, the confidence as a band has grown steadily. Performing as Daughter, guitarist Igor Haefeli believes working as a team is "for the best". 

"From playing solo before, at the moment, this is way more enjoyable and meaningful than what I was do- ing," agreed Elena. "I mean it was just uncomfortable being a solo project, but I don’t know how I’d feel now." Unnerving as it may be for an emerging band to get noticed in the UK, the prospect of a performance on David Letterman’s prime time American talk show, even for self-proclaimed introvert Elena, was a huge prospect.

"Was a very strange experience and our first TV gig as a band. We got there about five in the morning [to sound check] and went back when it was being filmed. It was a lengthy day but it was really fun, I think. It was nerve-wracking, we all looked pretty terrified when we look back at it," said Elena.

Watching back, an uncomfortable Elena looked about ready to leave when Letterman began to approach the band on stage. "I was! I was heading to the back and then he came over and went to shake my hand. I was sort of leaving and it was really awkward," recalled Elena.

However, as a learning curve, the band picked up on a few tips from their first television broadcasting experience. For example, don’t say "I’m ready", teased Igor.

"Yeah that was my big mistake," admitted Remi. "I think a producer of the show came to talk to me, and you know when you are used to playing gigs if someone comes to say ‘are you guys all good?’ it usually means you’ve got a couple minutes before you’ve got to go on stage. But it turns out on TV that if someone says ‘are you all good?’ it literally means guys we’re going to be shooting in 15 sec- onds so everybody get ready. Pretty much as soon as I said that I didn’t realise that everybody had cleared the stage and I heard David Letterman introducing us."

Now signed to 4AD, Daughter have been incredibly excited from the word go to work with the alternative independent label. Naming what could have easily been the entire roster of 4AD artists such as: The National, Grimes and Bon Iver, how did it feel to be among such a prestigious company?

"All of them definitely have something that is compelling to listen to, and it’s really inspiring to think all these artists released their work through 4AD. I think it keeps us on our artistic toes by staying conscious of the amazing creative stimulus out there."

As you may expect, their musical tastes stem far beyond their own genre, but there isn’t always consensus.

"There’s a lot of stuff we don’t agree on, like Remi’s love for Dire Straits or my love for Bjork or [pauses] Remi’s hatred for Jeff Buckley", Igor jokes. "We’re in the van and yeah we’ll play bad music sometimes, but yesterday we were listening to Offspring or some Rage Against the Machine as well," chimes Remi.

Working with other creatives to influence the band’s look has become important for the threesome when it comes to the visuals accompanying Daughter’s music. Sometimes these collaborations have been intentional, such as the use of Home on Grey’s Anatomy, and Love and Youth on Skins, but others are more surprising.

"There are things that we don’t get asked about because they are under a different kind of umbrella of TV and that can kind of sometimes be a bit weird, like the Tour De France advert. It was kind of cool but it was something we didn’t know was going to happen. My mum rung me and was like, ‘do you realise that you are on the Tour De France advert?’", shared Elena.

```The first songs I ever wrote weren’t really songs, they were more poems and it was really hidden in a drawer```

This is, however, by no means negative, as Elena smiles as she remembers the use of lyric ‘finish line’ in their single Youth. "There are many positives to having your music put to something else. I think it’s kind of the same as making music videos and that’s always been something we haven’t done as of yet. Instead, Daughter encourage new film mak- ers to access raw video clips of live performances via their website for their own remixes.

"We are interested in working with directors and other people who listen to the music and have a strong vision of what the music video should be. I think that’s really interesting to have somebody else’s perspective on something you’ve written."
