@igorhaefeli - A little bit of text I wrote with Elena about good times with @frabbits and what went into covering their song 'Poke'.

'Poke' - Daughter

We met Frightened Rabbit during a festival tour in Australia. It wasn't long before their honesty, warmth, and camaraderie bowled us over - we shared some great moments there. 
Since that first introduction, crossing their paths around the world always gave us a smile and a cheeky laugh. We recorded our cover of 'Poke' in our small studio in London during the grizzly month of January 2018. The repeated listening of Scott's words crept up on us, for all the reasons you can imagine, it has a very special place in our hearts.
