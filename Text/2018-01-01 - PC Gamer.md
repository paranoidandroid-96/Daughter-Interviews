# CAUGHT IN THE STORM
## Daughter’s Igor Haefeli on the soundtrack for Life is Strange: Before the Storm

London-based Daughter had never thought of creating a soundtrack for a videogame. When it was approached by Deck Nine, the trio had never even heard of *Life is Strange*. But as guitarist and vocalist Igor Haefeli explains, it allowed the band members to step outside of their own experiences. 

“It all happened quickly from the moment we said yes,” he says. “Apparently, [Deck Nine] had been listening to our music as inspiration. I guess they felt our music fit well with the story. They wanted us to do whatever we wanted to do. They said they really liked our music, the way we approach things, the way we tackled some themes in the past.” 

The band were given a synopsis but they had to create the music before the game was ready. “We sent stems to the audio team and they were able to time things appropriately for different scenes they wanted to use the music in.

“Our artistic ambitions and sensibilities, things we want to express, were always there,” Haefeli adds. “We always knew that it was to help someone else’s vision. We wouldn’t have had it any other way.”
